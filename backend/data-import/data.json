I have made my bed","In charnels and on coffins, where black death","Keeps record of the trophies won from thee,","Hoping to still these obstinate questionings","Of thee and thine, by forcing some lone ghost,","Thy messenger, to render up the tale","Of what we are. In lone and silent hours,","When night makes a weird sound of its own stillness,","Like an inspired and desperate alchymist","Staking his very life on some dark hope,","Have I mixed awful talk and asking looks","With my most innocent love, until strange tears,","Uniting with those breathless kisses, made","Such magic as compels the charmed night","To render up thy charge:...and, though ne'er yet","Thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary,","Enough from incommunicable dream,","And twilight phantasms, and deep noon-day thought,","Has shone within me, that serenely now","And moveless, as a long-forgotten lyre","Suspended in the solitary dome","Of some mysterious and deserted fane,","I wait thy breath, Great Parent, that my strain","May modulate with murmurs of the air,","And motions of the forests and the sea,","And voice of living beings, and woven hymns","Of night and day, and the deep heart of man.","","There was a Poet whose untimely tomb","No human hands with pious reverence reared,","But the charmed eddies of autumnal winds","Built o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid","Of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness:--","A lovely youth,--no mourning maiden decked","With weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath,","The lone couch of his everlasting sleep:--","Gentle, and brave, and generous,--no lorn bard","Breathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh:","He lived, he died, he sung in solitude.","Strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes,","And virgins, as unknown he passed, have pined","And wasted for fond love of his wild eyes.","The fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn,","And Silence, too enamoured of that voice,","Locks its mute music in her rugged cell.","","By solemn vision, and bright silver dream","His infancy was nurtured. Every sight","And sound from the vast earth and ambient air,","Sent to his heart its choicest impulses.","The fountains of divine philosophy","Fled not his thirsting lips, and all of great,","Or good, or lovely, which the sacred past","In truth or fable consecrates, he felt","And knew. When early youth had passed, he left","His cold fireside and alienated home","To seek strange truths in undiscovered lands.","Many a wide waste and tangled wilderness","Has lured his fearless steps; and he has bought","With his sweet voice and eyes, from savage men,","His rest and food. Nature's most secret steps","He like her shadow has pursued, where'er","The red volcano overcanopies","Its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice","With burning smoke, or where bitumen lakes","On black bare pointed islets ever beat","With sluggish surge, or where the secret caves,","Rugged and dark, winding among the springs","Of fire and poison, inaccessible","To avarice or pride, their starry domes","Of diamond and of gold expand above","Numberless and immeasurable halls,","Frequent with crystal column, and clear shrines","Of pearl, and thrones radiant with chrysolite.","Nor had that scene of ampler majesty","Than gems or gold, the varying roof of heaven","And the green earth lost in his heart its claims","To love and wonder; he would linger long","In lonesome vales, making the wild his home,","Until the doves and squirrels would partake","From his innocuous hand his bloodless food,","Lured by the gentle meaning of his looks,","And the wild antelope, that starts whene'er","The dry leaf rustles in the brake, suspend","Her timid steps, to gaze upon a form","More graceful than her own.","His wandering step,","Obedient to high thoughts, has visited","The awful ruins of the days of old:","Athens, and Tyre, and Balbec, and the waste","Where stood Jerusalem, the fallen towers","Of Babylon, the eternal pyramids,","Memphis and Thebes, and whatsoe'er of strange,","Sculptured on alabaster obelisk,","Or jasper tomb, or mutilated sphynx,","Dark Aethiopia in her desert hills","Conceals. Among the ruined temples there,","Stupendous columns, and wild images","Of more than man, where marble daemons watch","The Zodiac's brazen mystery, and dead men","Hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around,","He lingered, poring on memorials","Of the world's youth: through the long burning day","Gazed on those speechless shapes; nor, when the moon","Filled the mysterious halls with floating shades","Suspended he that task, but ever gazed","And gazed, till meaning on his vacant mind","Flashed like strong inspiration, and he saw","The thrilling secrets of the birth of time.","","Meanwhile an Arab maiden brought his food,","Her daily portion, from her father's tent,","And spread her matting for his couch, and stole","From duties and repose to tend his steps,","Enamoured, yet not daring for deep awe","To speak her love:--and watched his nightly sleep,","Sleepless herself, to gaze upon his lips","Parted in slumber, whence the regular breath","Of innocent dreams arose; then, when red morn","Made paler the pale moon, to her cold home","Wildered, and wan, and panting, she returned.","","The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie,","And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste,","And o'er the aerial mountains which pour down","Indus and Oxus from their icy caves,","In joy and exultation held his way;","Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within","Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine","Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower,","Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched","His languid limbs. A vision on his sleep","There came, a dream of hopes that never yet","Had flushed his cheek. He dreamed a veiled maid","Sate near him, talking in low solemn tones.","Her voice was like the voice of his own soul","Heard in the calm of thought; its music long,","Like woven sounds of streams and breezes, held","His inmost sense suspended in its web","Of many-coloured woof and shifting hues.","Knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme,","And lofty hopes of divine liberty,","Thoughts the most dear to him, and poesy,","Herself a poet. Soon the solemn mood","Of her pure mind kindled through all her frame","A permeating fire; wild numbers then","She raised, with voice stifled in tremulous sobs","Subdued by its own pathos; her fair hands","Were bare alone, sweeping from some strange harp","Strange symphony, and in their branching veins","The eloquent blood told an ineffable tale.","The beating of her heart was heard to fill","The pauses of her music, and her breath","Tumultuously accorded with those fits","Of intermitted song. Sudden she rose,","As if her heart impatiently endured","Its bursting burthen: at the sound he turned,","And saw by the warm light of their own life","Her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil","Of woven wind, her outspread arms now bare,","Her dark locks floating in the breath of night,","Her beamy bending eyes, her parted lips","Outstretched, and pale, and quivering eagerly.","His strong heart sunk and sickened with excess","Of love. He reared his shuddering limbs and quelled","His gasping breath, and spread his arms to meet","Her panting bosom:...she drew back a while,","Then, yielding to the irresistible joy,","With frantic gesture and short breathless cry","Folded his frame in her dissolving arms.","Now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes, and night","Involved and swallowed up the vision; sleep,","Like a dark flood suspended in its course,","Rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain.","","Roused by the shock he started from his trance--","The cold white light of morning, the blue moon","Low in the west, the clear and garish hills,","The distinct valley and the vacant woods,","Spread round him where he stood. Whither have fled","The hues of heaven that canopied his bower","Of yesternight? The sounds that soothed his sleep,","The mystery and the majesty of Earth,","The joy, the exultation? His wan eyes","Gaze on the empty scene as vacantly","As ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven.","The spirit of sweet human love has sent","A vision to the sleep of him who spurned","Her choicest gifts. He eagerly pursues","Beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade;","He overleaps the bounds. Alas! Alas!","Were limbs, and breath, and being intertwined","Thus treacherously? Lost, lost, for ever lost","In the wide pathless desert of dim sleep,","That beautiful shape! Does the dark gate of death","Conduct to thy mysterious paradise,","O Sleep? Does the bright arch of rainbow clouds","And pendent mountains seen in the calm lake,","Lead only to a black and watery depth,","While death's blue vault, with loathliest vapours hung,","Where every shade which the foul grave exhales","Hides its dead eye from the detested day,","Conducts, O Sleep, to thy delightful realms?","This doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart;","The insatiate hope which it awakened, stung","His brain even like despair.","While daylight held","The sky, the Poet kept mute conference","With his still soul. At night the passion came,","Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream,","And shook him from his rest, and led him forth","Into the darkness.--As an eagle, grasped","In folds of the green serpent, feels her breast","Burn with the poison, and precipitates","Through night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud,","Frantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flight","O'er the wide aery wilderness: thus driven","By the bright shadow of that lovely dream,","Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night,","Through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells,","Startling with careless step the moonlight snake,","He fled. Red morning dawned upon his flight,","Shedding the mockery of its vital hues","Upon his cheek of death. He wandered on","Till vast Aornos seen from Petra's steep","Hung o'er the low horizon like a cloud;","Through Balk, and where the desolated tombs","Of Parthian kings scatter to every wind","Their wasting dust, wildly he wandered on,","Day after day a weary waste of hours,","Bearing within his life the brooding care","That ever fed on its decaying flame.","And now his limbs were lean; his scattered hair,","Sered by the autumn of strange suffering","Sung dirges in the wind; his listless hand","Hung like dead bone within its withered skin;","Life, and the lustre that consumed it, shone","As in a furnace burning secretly","From his dark eyes alone. The cottagers,","Who ministered with human charity","His human wants, beheld with wondering awe","Their fleeting visitant. The mountaineer,","Encountering on some dizzy precipice","That spectral form, deemed that the Spirit of wind","With lightning eyes, and eager breath, and feet","Disturbing not the drifted snow, had paused","In its career: the infant would conceal","His troubled visage in his mother's robe","In terror at the glare of those wild eyes,","To remember their strange light in many a dream","Of after-times; but youthful maidens, taught","By nature, would interpret half the woe","That wasted him, would call him with false names","Brother and friend, would press his pallid hand","At parting, and watch, dim through tears, the path","Of his departure from their father's door.","","At length upon the lone Chorasmian shore","He paused, a wide and melancholy waste","Of putrid marshes. A strong impulse urged","His steps to the sea-shore. A swan was there,","Beside a sluggish stream among the reeds.","It rose as he approached, and, with strong wings","Scaling the upward sky, bent its bright course","High over the immeasurable main.","His eyes pursued its flight:--'Thou hast a home,","Beautiful bird; thou voyagest to thine home,","Where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck","With thine, and welcome thy return with eyes","Bright in the lustre of their own fond joy.","And what am I that I should linger here,","With voice far sweeter than thy dying notes,","Spirit more vast than thine, frame more attuned","To beauty, wasting these surpassing powers","In the deaf air, to the blind earth, and heaven","That echoes not my thoughts?' A gloomy smile","Of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips.","For sleep, he knew, kept most relentlessly","Its precious charge, and silent death exposed,","Faithless perhaps as sleep, a shadowy lure,","With doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms.","","Startled by his own thoughts he looked around.","There was no fair fiend near him, not a sight","Or sound of awe but in his own deep mind.","A little shallop floating near the shore","Caught the impatient wandering of his gaze.","It had been long abandoned, for its sides","Gaped wide with many a rift, and its frail joints","Swayed with the undulations of the tide.","A restless impulse urged him to embark","And meet lone Death on the drear ocean's waste;","For well he knew that mighty Shadow loves","The slimy caverns of the populous deep.","","The day was fair and sunny; sea and sky","Drank its inspiring radiance, and the wind","Swept strongly from the shore, blackening the waves.","Following his eager soul, the wanderer","Leaped in the boat, he spread his cloak aloft","On the bare mast, and took his lonely seat,","And felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea","Like a torn cloud before the hurricane.","","As one that in a silver vision floats","Obedient to the sweep of odorous winds","Upon resplendent clouds, so rapidly","Along the dark and ruffled waters fled","The straining boat.--A whirlwind swept it on,","With fierce gusts and precipitating force,","Through the white ridges of the chafed sea.","The waves arose. Higher and higher still","Their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest's scourge","Like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp.","Calm and rejoicing in the fearful war","Of wave ruining on wave, and blast on blast","Descending, and black flood on whirlpool driven","With dark obliterating course, he sate:","As if their genii were the ministers","Appointed to conduct him to the light","Of those beloved eyes, the Poet sate,","Holding the steady helm. Evening came on,","The beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues","High 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray","That canopied his path o'er the waste deep;","Twilight, ascending slowly from the east,","Entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks","O'er the fair front and radiant eyes of day;","Night followed, clad with stars. On every side","More horribly the multitudinous streams","Of ocean's mountainous waste to mutual war","Rushed in dark tumult thundering, as to mock","The calm and spangled sky. The little boat","Still fled before the storm; still fled, like foam","Down the steep cataract of a wintry river;","Now pausing on the edge of the riven wave;","Now leaving far behind the bursting mass","That fell, convulsing ocean: safely fled--","As if that frail and wasted human form,","Had been an elemental god.","","At midnight","The moon arose; and lo! the ethereal cliffs","Of Caucasus, whose icy summits shone","Among the stars like sunlight, and around","Whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves","Bursting and eddying irresistibly","Rage and resound forever.--Who shall save?--","The boat fled on,--the boiling torrent drove,--","The crags closed round with black and jagged arms,","The shattered mountain overhung the sea,","And faster still, beyond all human speed,","Suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave,","The little boat was driven. A cavern there","Yawned, and amid its slant and winding depths","Ingulfed the rushing sea. The boat fled on","With unrelaxing speed.--'Vision and Love!'","The Poet cried aloud, 'I have beheld","The path of thy departure. Sleep and death","Shall not divide us long.'","","The boat pursued","The windings of the cavern. Daylight shone","At length upon that gloomy river's flow;","Now, where the fiercest war among the waves","Is calm, on the unfathomable stream","The boat moved slowly. Where the mountain, riven,","Exposed those black depths to the azure sky,","Ere yet the flood's enormous volume fell","Even to the base of Caucasus, with sound","That shook the everlasting rocks, the mass","Filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm:","Stair above stair the eddying waters rose,","Circling immeasurably fast, and laved","With alternating dash the gnarled roots","Of mighty trees, that stretched their giant arms","In darkness over it. I' the midst was left,","Reflecting, yet distorting every cloud,","A pool of treacherous and tremendous calm.","Seized by the sway of the ascending stream,","With dizzy swiftness, round, and round, and round,","Ridge after ridge the straining boat arose,","Till on the verge of the extremest curve,","Where, through an opening of the rocky bank,","The waters overflow, and a smooth spot","Of glassy quiet mid those battling tides","Is left, the boat paused shuddering.--Shall it sink","Down the abyss? Shall the reverting stress","Of that resistless gulf embosom it?","Now shall it fall?--A wandering stream of wind,","Breathed from the west, has caught the expanded sail,","And, lo! with gentle motion, between banks","Of mossy slope, and on a placid stream,","Beneath a woven grove it sails, and, hark!","The ghastly torrent mingles its far roar,","With the breeze murmuring in the musical woods.","Where the embowering trees recede, and leave","A little space of green expanse, the cove","Is closed by meeting banks, whose yellow flowers","For ever gaze on their own drooping eyes,","Reflected in the crystal calm. The wave","Of the boat's motion marred their pensive task,","Which naught but vagrant bird, or wanton wind,","Or falling spear-grass, or their own decay","Had e'er disturbed before. The Poet longed","To deck with their bright hues his withered hair,","But on his heart its solitude returned,","And he forbore. Not the strong impulse hid","In those flushed cheeks, bent eyes, and shadowy frame","Had yet performed its ministry: it hung","Upon his life, as lightning in a cloud","Gleams, hovering ere it vanish, ere the floods","Of night close over it.","The noonday sun","Now shone upon the forest, one vast mass","Of mingling shade, whose brown magnificence","A narrow vale embosoms. There, huge caves,","Scooped in the dark base of their aery rocks,","Mocking its moans, respond and roar for ever.","The meeting boughs and implicated leaves","Wove twilight o'er the Poet's path, as led","By love, or dream, or god, or mightier Death,","He sought in Nature's dearest haunt some bank,","Her cradle, and his sepulchre. More dark","And dark the shades accumulate. The oak,","Expanding its immense and knotty arms,","Embraces the light beech. The pyramids","Of the tall cedar overarching frame","Most solemn domes within, and far below,","Like clouds suspended in an emerald sky,","The ash and the acacia floating hang","Tremulous and pale. Like restless serpents, clothed","In rainbow and in fire, the parasites,","Starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around","The grey trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes,","With gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles,","Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love,","These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs","Uniting their close union; the woven leaves","Make net-work of the dark blue light of day,","And the night's noontide clearness, mutable","As shapes in the weird clouds. Soft mossy lawns","Beneath these canopies extend their swells,","Fragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms","Minute yet beautiful. One darkest glen","Sends from its woods of musk-rose, twined with jasmine,","A soul-dissolving odour to invite","To some more lovely mystery. Through the dell,","Silence and Twilight here, twin-sisters, keep","Their noonday watch, and sail among the shades,","Like vaporous shapes half-seen; beyond, a well,","Dark, gleaming, and of most translucent wave,","Images all the woven boughs above,","And each depending leaf, and every speck","Of azure sky, darting between their chasms;","Nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves","Its portraiture, but some inconstant star","Between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair,","Or painted bird, sleeping beneath the moon,","Or gorgeous insect floating motionless,","Unconscious of the day, ere yet his wings","Have spread their glories to the gaze of noon.","","Hither the Poet came. His eyes beheld","Their own wan light through the reflected lines","Of his thin hair, distinct in the dark depth","Of that still fountain; as the human heart,","Gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave,","Sees its own treacherous likeness there. He heard","The motion of the leaves, the grass that sprung","Startled and glanced and trembled even to feel","An unaccustomed presence, and the sound","Of the sweet brook that from the secret springs","Of that dark fountain rose. A Spirit seemed","To stand beside him--clothed in no bright robes","Of shadowy silver or enshrining light,","Borrowed from aught the visible world affords","Of grace, or majesty, or mystery;--","But, undulating woods, and silent well,","And leaping rivulet, and evening gloom","Now deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming,","Held commune with him, as if he and it","Were all that was,--only...when his regard","Was raised by intense pensiveness,...two eyes,","Two starry eyes, hung in the gloom of thought,","And seemed with their serene and azure smiles","To beckon him.","","Obedient to the light","That shone within his soul, he went, pursuing","The windings of the dell.--The rivulet,","Wanton and wild, through many a green ravine","Beneath the forest flowed. Sometimes it fell","Among the moss with hollow harmony","Dark and profound. Now on the polished stones","It danced; like childhood laughing as it went:","Then, through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept,","Reflecting every herb and drooping bud","That overhung its quietness.--'O stream!","Whose source is inaccessibly profound,","Whither do thy mysterious waters tend?","Thou imagest my life. Thy darksome stillness,","Thy dazzling waves, thy loud and hollow gulfs,","Thy searchless fountain, and invisible course","Have each their type in me; and the wide sky.","And measureless ocean may declare as soon","What oozy cavern or what wandering cloud","Contains thy waters, as the universe","Tell where these living thoughts reside, when stretched","Upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste","I' the passing wind!'","","Beside the grassy shore","Of the small stream he went; he did impress","On the green moss his tremulous step, that caught","Strong shuddering from his burning limbs. As one","Roused by some joyous madness from the couch","Of fever, he did move; yet, not like him,","Forgetful of the grave, where, when the flame","Of his frail exultation shall be spent,","He must descend. With rapid steps he went","Beneath the shade of trees, beside the flow","Of the wild babbling rivulet; and now","The forest's solemn canopies were changed","For the uniform and lightsome evening sky.","Grey rocks did peep from the spare moss, and stemmed","The struggling brook; tall spires of windlestrae","Threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope,","And nought but gnarled roots of ancient pines","Branchless and blasted, clenched with grasping roots","The unwilling soil. A gradual change was here,","Yet ghastly. For, as fast years flow away,","The smooth brow gathers, and the hair grows thin","And white, and where irradiate dewy eyes","Had shone, gleam stony orbs:--so from his steps","Bright flowers departed, and the beautiful shade","Of the green groves, with all their odorous winds","And musical motions. Calm, he still pursued","The stream, that with a larger volume now","Rolled through the labyrinthine dell; and there","Fretted a path through its descending curves","With its wintry speed. On every side now rose","Rocks, which, in unimaginable forms,","Lifted their black and barren pinnacles","In the light of evening, and its precipice","Obscuring the ravine, disclosed above,","Mid toppling stones, black gulfs and yawning caves,","Whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues","To the loud stream. Lo! where the pass expands","Its stony jaws, the abrupt mountain breaks,","And seems, with its accumulated crags,","To overhang the world: for wide expand","Beneath the wan stars and descending moon","Islanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams,","Dim tracts and vast, robed in the lustrous gloom","Of leaden-coloured even, and fiery hills","Mingling their flames with twilight, on the verge","Of the remote horizon. The near scene,","In naked and severe simplicity,","Made contrast with the universe. A pine,","Rock-rooted, stretched athwart the vacancy","Its swinging boughs, to each inconstant blast","Yielding one only response, at each pause","In most familiar cadence, with the howl","The thunder and the hiss of homeless streams","Mingling its solemn song, whilst the broad river","Foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path,","Fell into that immeasurable void","Scattering its waters to the passing winds.","","Yet the grey precipice and solemn pine","And torrent were not all;--one silent nook","Was there. Even on the edge of that vast mountain,","Upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks,","It overlooked in its serenity","The dark earth, and the bending vault of stars.","It was a tranquil spot, that seemed to smile","Even in the lap of horror. Ivy clasped","The fissured stones with its entwining arms,","And did embower with leaves for ever green,","And berries dark, the smooth and even space","Of its inviolated floor, and here","The children of the autumnal whirlwind bore,","In wanton sport, those bright leaves, whose decay,","Red, yellow, or ethereally pale,","Rivals the pride of summer. 'Tis the haunt","Of every gentle wind, whose breath can teach","The wilds to love tranquillity. One step,","One human step alone, has ever broken","The stillness of its solitude:--one voice","Alone inspired its echoes;--even that voice","Which hither came, floating among the winds,","And led the loveliest among human forms","To make their wild haunts the depository","Of all the grace and beauty that endued","Its motions, render up its majesty,","Scatter its music on the unfeeling storm,","And to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould,","Nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss,","Commit the colours of that varying cheek,","That snowy breast, those dark and drooping eyes.","","The dim and horned moon hung low, and poured","A sea of lustre on the horizon's verge","That overflowed its mountains. Yellow mist","Filled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank","Wan moonlight even to fulness; not a star","Shone, not a sound was heard; the very winds,","Danger's grim playmates, on that precipice","Slept, clasped in his embrace.--O, storm of death!","Whose sightless speed divides this sullen night: 610","And thou, colossal Skeleton, that, still","Guiding its irresistible career","In thy devastating omnipotence,","Art king of this frail world, from the red field","Of slaughter, from the reeking hospital,","The patriot's sacred couch, the snowy bed","Of innocence, the scaffold and the throne,","A mighty voice invokes thee. Ruin calls","His brother Death. A rare and regal prey","He hath prepared, prowling around the world;","Glutted with which thou mayst repose, and men","Go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms,","Nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine","The unheeded tribute of a broken heart.","","When on the threshold of the green recess","The wanderer's footsteps fell, he knew that death","Was on him. Yet a little, ere it fled,","Did he resign his high and holy soul","To images of the majestic past,","That paused within his passive being now,","Like winds that bear sweet music, when they breathe","Through some dim latticed chamber. He did place","His pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk","Of the old pine. Upon an ivied stone","Reclined his languid head, his limbs did rest,","Diffused and motionless, on the smooth brink","Of that obscurest chasm;--and thus he lay,","Surrendering to their final impulses","The hovering powers of life. Hope and despair,","The torturers, slept; no mortal pain or fear","Marred his repose; the influxes of sense,","And his own being unalloyed by pain,","Yet feebler and more feeble, calmly fed","The stream of thought, till he lay breathing there","At peace, and faintly smiling:--his last sight","Was the great moon, which o'er the western line","Of the wide world her mighty horn suspended,","With whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed","To mingle. Now upon the jagged hills","It rests; and still as the divided frame","Of the vast meteor sunk, the Poet's blood,","That ever beat in mystic sympathy","With nature's ebb and flow, grew feebler still:","And when two lessening points of light alone","Gleamed through the darkness, the alternate gasp","Of his faint respiration scarce did stir","The stagnate night:--till the minutest ray","Was quenched, the pulse yet lingered in his heart.","It paused--it fluttered. But when heaven remained","Utterly black, the murky shades involved","An image, silent, cold, and motionless,","As their own voiceless earth and vacant air.","Even as a vapour fed with golden beams","That ministered on sunlight, ere the west","Eclipses it, was now that wondrous frame--","No sense, no motion, no divinity--","A fragile lute, on whose harmonious strings","The breath of heaven did wander--a bright stream","Once fed with many-voiced waves--a dream","Of youth, which night and time have quenched for ever,","Still, dark, and dry, and unremembered now.","","Oh, for Medea's wondrous alchemy,","Which wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam","With bright flowers, and the wintry boughs exhale","From vernal blooms fresh fragrance! O, that God,","Profuse of poisons, would concede the chalice","Which but one living man has drained, who now,","Vessel of deathless wrath, a slave that feels","No proud exemption in the blighting curse","He bears, over the world wanders for ever,","Lone as incarnate death! O, that the dream","Of dark magician in his visioned cave,","Raking the cinders of a crucible","For life and power, even when his feeble hand","Shakes in its last decay, were the true law","Of this so lovely world! But thou art fled,","Like some frail exhalation; which the dawn","Robes in its golden beams,--ah! thou hast fled!","The brave, the gentle and the beautiful,","The child of grace and genius. Heartless things","Are done and said i' the world, and many worms","And beasts and men live on, and mighty Earth","From sea and mountain, city and wilderness,","In vesper low or joyous orison,","Lifts still its solemn voice:--but thou art fled--","Thou canst no longer know or love the shapes","Of this phantasmal scene, who have to thee","Been purest ministers, who are, alas!","Now thou art not. Upon those pallid lips","So sweet even in their silence, on those eyes","That image sleep in death, upon that form","Yet safe from the worm's outrage, let no tear","Be shed--not even in thought.

liking well","To smooth the dropples as they fell","","One scarce could keep one's path aright","From gazing upward at the sight","","The boys for wet are forced to pass","The cuckoo flowers among the grass","To hasten on as well they may","For hedge or tree or stack of hay","Where they for shelter can abide","Safe seated by its sloping side","That by the blackthorn thicket cowers","A shelter in the strongest showers","","The gardens golden gilliflowers","Are paled with drops of amber showers","","Dead leaves from hedges flirt about","The chaff from barn doors winnows out","And down without a wing to flye","As fast as bees goes sailing bye","The feather finds a wing to flye","And dust in wirl puffs winnows bye","","When the rain at midday stops","Spangles glitter in the drops","And as each thread a sunbeam was","Cobwebs glitter in the grass","","The sheep all loaded with the rain","Try to shake it off in vain","And ere dryed by wind and sun","The load will scarcely let them run","","The shepherds foot is sodden through","And leaves will clout his brushing shoe","The buttercups in gold alloyed","And daiseys by the shower destroyed","","The sun is overcast clouds lie","And thicken over all the sky","","Crows morn and eve will flock in crowds","To fens and darken like the clouds","So many is their cumberous flight","The dull eve darkens into night","","Clouds curl and curdle blue and grey","And dapple the young summers day","","Through the torn woods the violent rain","Roars and rattles oer the plain","And bubbles up in every pool","Till dykes and ponds are brimming full","","The thickening clouds move slowly on","Till all the many clouds are one","That spreads oer all the face of day","And turns the sunny shine to grey","","Now the meadow water smokes","And hedgerows dripping oaks","Fitter patter all around","And dimple the once dusty ground","The spinners threads about the weeds","Are hung with little drops in beads","Clover silver green becomes","And purple blue surrounds the plumbs","And every place breaths fresh and fair","When morning pays her visit there","","The day is dull the heron trails","On flapping wings like heavy sails","And oer the mead so lowly swings","She fans the herbage with her wings","","The waterfowl with suthering wings","Dive down the river splash and spring","Up to the very clouds again","That sprinkle scuds of coming rain","That flye and drizzle all the day","Till dripping grass is turned to grey","","The various clouds that move or lye","Like mighty travellers in the sky","All mountainously ridged or curled","That may have travelled round the world","","The water ruckles into waves","And loud the neighbouring woodland raves","All telling of the coming storm","That fills the village with alarm","","Ere yet the sun is two hours high","Winds find all quarters of the sky","With sudden shiftings all around","And now the grass upon the ground","And now the leaves they wirl and wirl","With many a flirting flap and curl"],"linecount":"116"},{"title":"Sonnet 83: I never saw that you did painting need","author":"William Shakespeare","lines":["I never saw that you did painting need,","And therefore to your fair no

hard to say, if greater want of skill","Appear in writing or in judging ill;","But, of the two, less dangerous is the offence","To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.","Some few in that, but numbers err in this;","Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss;","A fool might once himself alone expose,","Now one in verse makes many more in prose.","","'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none","Go just alike, yet each believes his own.","In poets as true genius is but rare,","True taste as seldom, is the critic's share;","Both must alike from Heaven derive their light,","These born to judge, as well as those to write.","Let such teach others who themselves excel.","And censure freely who have written well.","Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true,","But are not critics to their judgment too?","","Yet if we look more closely, we shall find","Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind:","Nature affords at least a glimmering light;","The lines, though touch'd but faintly, are drawn right.","But as the slightest sketch, if justly traced,","Is by ill colouring but the more disgraced,","So by false learning is good sense defaced:","Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools,","And some made coxcombs Nature meant but fools.","In search of wit these lose their common sense,","And then turn critics in their own defence:","Each burns alike, who can, or cannot write,","Or with a rival's, or an eunuch's spite.","All fools have still an itching to deride,","And fain would be upon the laughing side;","If Maevius scribble in Apollo's spite,","There are who judge still worse than he can write.","","Some have at first for wits, then poets pass'd,","Turn'd critics next, and proved plain fools at last.","Some neither can for wits nor critics pass,","As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass.","Those half-learn'd witlings, numerous in our isle,","As half-form'd insects on the banks of Nile;","Unfinished things, one knows not what to call,","Their generation's so equivocal:","To tell 'em would a hundred tongues require,","Or one vain wit's, that might a hundred tire.","","But you who seek to give and merit fame,","And justly bear a critic's noble name,","Be sure yourself and your own reach to know,","How far your genius, taste, and learning go;","Launch not beyond your depth, but be discreet,","And mark that point where sense and dulness meet.","","Nature to all things fix'd the limits fit,","And wisely curb'd proud man's pretending wit.","As on the land while here the ocean gains,","In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains;","Thus in the soul while memory prevails,","The solid power of understanding fails;","Where beams of warm imagination play,","The memory's soft figures melt away.","One science only will one genius fit,","So vast is art, so narrow human wit:","Not only bounded to peculiar arts,","But oft in those confined to single parts.","Like kings, we lose the conquests gain'd before,","By vain ambition still to make them more;","Each might his several province well command,","Would all but stoop to what they understand.","","First follow Nature, and your judgment frame","By her just standard, which is still the same:","Unerring Nature, still divinely bright,","One clear, unchanged, and universal light,","Life, force, and beauty, must to all impart,","At once the source, and end, and test of Art.","Art from that fund each just supply provides,","Works without show, and without pomp presides;","In some fair body thus the informing soul","With spirits feeds, with vigour fills the whole,","Each motion guides, and every nerve sustains,","Itself unseen, but in the effects, remains.","Some, to whom Heaven in wit has been profuse,","Want as much more to turn it to its use;","For wit and judgment often are at strife,","Though meant each other's aid, like man and wife,","'Tis more to guide than spur the Muse's steed,","Restrain his fury, than provoke his speed;","The wingèd courser, like a generous horse,","Shows most true mettle when you check his course.","","Those rules, of old discover'd, not devised,","Are Nature still, but Nature methodised;","Nature, like liberty, is but restrain'd","By the same laws which first herself ordain'd.","Hear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites,","When to repress, and when indulge our flights:","High on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd,","And pointed out those arduous paths they trod;","Held from afar, aloft, the immortal prize,","And urged the rest by equal steps to rise.","Just precepts thus from great examples given,","She drew from them what they derived from Heaven.","The generous critic fann'd the poet's fire,","And taught the world with reason to admire.","Then Criticism the Muse's handmaid proved,","To dress her charms, and make her more beloved:","But following wits from that intention stray'd,","Who could not win the mistress, woo'd the maid;","Against the poets their own arms they turn'd,","Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd.","So modern 'pothecaries, taught the art,","By doctor's bills to play the doctor's part,","Bold in the practice of mistaken rules,","Prescribe, apply, and call their masters fools.","Some on the leaves of ancient authors prey,","Nor time nor moths e'er spoil'd so much as they.","Some drily plain, without invention's aid,","Write dull receipts how poems may be made.","These leave the sense, their learning to display,","And those explain the meaning quite away.","","You then, whose judgment the right course would steer,","Know well each ancient's proper character;","His fable, subject, scope in every page;","Religion, country, genius of his age;","Without all these at once before your eyes,","Cavil you may, but never criticise.","Be Homer's works your study and delight,","Read them by day, and meditate by night;","Thence form your judgment, thence your maxims bring,","And trace the Muses upward to their spring.","Still with itself compared, his text peruse;","And let your comment be the Mantuan Muse.","When first young Maro in his boundless mind,","A work t' outlast immortal Rome design'd,","Perhaps he seem'd above the critic's law,","And but from Nature's fountains scorn'd to draw:","But when t' examine every part he came,","Nature and Homer were, he found, the same.","Convinced, amazed, he checks the bold design,","And rules as strict his labour'd work confine,","As if the Stagyrite o'erlook'd each line.","Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem;","To copy nature is to copy them.","Some beauties yet no precepts can declare,","For there's a happiness as well as care.","Music resembles poetry, in each","Are nameless graces which no methods teach,","And which a master-hand alone can reach.","If, where the rules not far enough extend,","(Since rules were made but to promote their end)","Some lucky license answer to the full","The intent proposed, that license is a rule;","Thus Pegasus, a nearer way to take,","May boldly deviate from the common track;","Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend,","And rise to faults true critics dare not mend,","From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part,","And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,","Which, without passing through the judgment, gains","The heart, and all its end at once attains.","In prospects thus, some objects please our eyes,","Which out of nature's common order rise,","The shapeless rock, or hanging precipice.","But though the ancients thus their rules invade,","(As kings dispense with laws themselves have made)","Moderns, beware! or if you must offend","Against the precept, ne'er transgress its end;","Let it be seldom, and compell'd by need,","And have at least their precedent to plead.","The critic else proceeds without remorse,","Seizes your fame, and puts his laws in force.","","I know there are, to whose presumptuous thoughts,","Those freer beauties, even in them, seem faults.","Some figures monstrous and misshaped appear,","Consider'd singly, or beheld too near,","Which, but proportion'd to their light, or place,","Due distance reconciles to form and grace.","A prudent chief not always must display","His powers in equal ranks, and fair array,","But with the occasion and the place comply,","Conceal his force, nay, seem sometimes to fly.","Those oft are stratagems which errors seem,","Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream.","","Still green with bays each ancient altar stands,","Above the reach of sacrilegious hands;","Secure from flames, from envy's fiercer rage,","Destructive war, and all-involving age.","See from each clime the learn'd their incense bring!","Hear in all tongues consenting paeans ring!","In praise so just let every voice be join'd,","And fill the general chorus of mankind.","Hail, Bards triumphant! born in happier days;","Immortal heirs of universal praise!","Whose honours with increase of ages grow,","As streams roll down, enlarging as they flow;","Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound,","And worlds applaud that must not yet be found!","Oh may some spark of your celestial fire,","The last, the meanest of your sons inspire,","(That on weak wings, from far, pursues your flights,","Glows while he reads, but trembles as he writes)","To teach vain wits a science little known,","T' admire superior sense, and doubt their own!","","PART SECOND.","","Of all the causes which conspire to blind","Man's erring judgment, and misguide the mind,","What the weak head with strongest bias rules,","Is PRIDE, the never-failing vice of fools.","Whatever Nature has in worth denied,","She gives in large recruits of needless pride;","For as in bodies, thus in souls, we find","What wants in blood and spirits, swell'd with wind:","Pride, where wit fails, steps in to our defence,","And fills up all the mighty void of sense:","If once right reason drives that cloud away,","Truth breaks upon us with resistless day.","Trust not yourself; but your defects to know,","Make use of every friend--and every foe.","","A little learning is a dangerous thing;","Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:","There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,","And drinking largely sobers us again.","Fired at first sight with what the Muse imparts,","In fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts,","While from the bounded level of our mind,","Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind;","But, more advanced, behold with strange surprise,","New distant scenes of endless science rise!","So, pleased at first the towering Alps we try,","Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky,","The eternal snows appear already past,","And the first clouds and mountains seem the last:","But, those attain'd, we tremble to survey","The growing labours of the lengthen'd way,","The increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes,","Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise!","","A perfect judge will read each work of wit","With the same spirit that its author writ:","Survey the WHOLE, nor seek slight faults to find","Where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind;","Nor lose, for that malignant dull delight,","The generous pleasure to be charm'd with wit.","But in such lays as neither ebb nor flow,","Correctly cold, and regularly low,","That, shunning faults, one quiet tenor keep,","We cannot blame indeed--but we may sleep.","In wit, as nature, what affects our hearts","Is not the exactness of peculiar parts;","'Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call,","But the joint force and full result of all.","Thus when we view some well-proportion'd dome,","(The world's just wonder, and even thine, O Rome!)","No single parts unequally surprise,","All comes united to th' admiring eyes;","No monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear;","The whole at once is bold, and regular.","","Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see,","Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.","In every work regard the writer's end,","Since none can compass more than they intend;","And if the means be just, the conduct true,","Applause, in spite of trivial faults, is due.","As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit,","To avoid great errors, must the less commit:","Neglect the rules each verbal critic lays,","For not to know some trifles is a praise.","Most critics, fond of some subservient art,","Still make the whole depend upon a part:","They talk of principles, but notions prize,","And all to one loved folly sacrifice.","","Once on a time, La Mancha's knight, they say,","A certain bard encountering on the way,","Discoursed in terms as just, with looks as sage,","As e'er could Dennis, of the Grecian stage;","Concluding all were desperate sots and fools,","Who durst depart from Aristotle's rules.","Our author, happy in a judge so nice,","Produced his play, and begg'd the knight's advice;","Made him observe the subject, and the plot,","The Manners, Passions, Unities; what not?","All which, exact to rule, were brought about,","Were but a combat in the lists left out.","'What! leave the combat out?' exclaims the knight.","'Yes, or we must renounce the Stagyrite.'","'Not so, by Heaven!' (he answers in a rage);","'Knights, squires, and steeds must enter on the stage.'","'So vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain.'","'Then build a new, or act it in a plain.'","","Thus critics, of less judgment than caprice,","Curious, not knowing, not exact but nice,","Form short ideas, and offend in arts","(As most in manners) by a love to parts.","","Some to conceit alone their taste confine,","And glittering thoughts struck out at every line;","Pleased with a work where nothing's just or fit;","One glaring chaos and wild heap of wit.","Poets, like painters, thus, unskill'd to trace","The naked nature and the living grace,","With gold and jewels cover every part,","And hide with ornaments their want of art.","True wit is nature to advantage dress'd;","What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd;","Something, whose truth convinced at sight we find,","That gives us back the image of our mind.","As shades more sweetly recommend the light,","So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit.","For works may have more wit than does 'em good,","As bodies perish through excess of blood.","","Others for language all their care express,","And value books, as women men, for dress:","Their praise is still--'The style is excellent;'","The sense, they humbly take upon content.","Words are like leaves, and where they most abound,","Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found.","False eloquence, like the prismatic glass,","Its gaudy colours spreads on every place;","The face of Nature we no more survey,","All glares alike, without distinction gay;","But true expression, like the unchanging sun,","Clears, and improves whate'er it shines upon;","It gilds all objects, but it alters none.","Expression is the dress of thought, and still","Appears more decent, as more suitable;","A vile conceit in pompous words express'd,","Is like a clown in regal purple dress'd:","For different styles with different subjects sort,","As several garbs with country, town, and court.","Some by old words to fame have made pretence,","Ancients in phrase, mere moderns in their sense;","Such labour'd nothings, in so strange a style,","Amaze the unlearn'd, and make the learnèd smile.","Unlucky, as Fungoso in the play,","These sparks with awkward vanity display","What the fine gentleman wore yesterday;","And but so mimic ancient wits at best,","As apes our grandsires, in their doublets dress'd.","In words, as fashions, the same rule will hold;","Alike fantastic, if too new, or old:","Be not the first by whom the new are tried,","Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.","","But most by numbers judge a poet's song;","And smooth or rough, with them, is right or wrong:","In the bright Muse, though thousand charms conspire,","Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire;","Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear,","Not mend their minds; as some to church repair,","Not for the doctrine, but the music there.","These equal syllables alone require,","Though oft the ear the open vowels tire;","While expletives their feeble aid do join,","And ten low words oft creep in one dull line:","While they ring round the same unvaried chimes,","With sure returns of still expected rhymes;","Where'er you find 'the cooling western breeze,'","In the next line, it 'whispers through the trees:'","If crystal streams 'with pleasing murmurs creep,'","The reader's threaten'd (not in vain) with 'sleep:'","Then, at the last and only couplet fraught","With some unmeaning thing they call a thought,","A needless Alexandrine ends the song","That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.","Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and know","What's roundly smooth, or languishingly slow;","And praise the easy vigour of a line,","Where Denham's strength, and Waller's sweetness join.","True ease in writing comes from art, not chance,","As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance.","'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence,","The sound must seem an echo to the sense;","Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows,","And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows:","But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,","The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar.","When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,","The line too labours, and the words move slow;","Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,","Flies o'er the unbending corn, and skims along the main.","Hear how Timotheus' varied lays surprise,","And bid alternate passions fall and rise!","While, at each change, the son of Libyan Jove","Now burns with glory, and then melts with love;","Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow,","Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow:","Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found,","And the world's victor stood subdued by sound!","The power of music all our hearts allow,","And what Timotheus was, is Dryden now.","","Avoid extremes; and shun the fault of such","Who still are pleased, too little or too much.","At every trifle scorn to take offence:","That always shows great pride or little sense;","Those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best","Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest.","Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move,","For fools admire, but men of sense approve:","As things seem large which we through mists descry,","Dulness is ever apt to magnify.","","Some, foreign writers, some, our own despise;","The ancients only, or the moderns prize.","Thus wit, like faith, by each man is applied","To one small sect, and all are damn'd beside.","Meanly they seek the blessing to confine,","And force that sun but on a part to shine,","Which not alone the southern wit sublimes,","But ripens spirits in cold northern climes;","Which from the first has shone on ages past,","Enlights the present, and shall warm the last;","Though each may feel increases and decays,","And see now clearer and now darker days.","Regard not then if wit be old or new,","But blame the false, and value still the true.","","Some ne'er advance a judgment of their own,","But catch the spreading notion of the town;","They reason and conclude by precedent,","And own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent.","Some judge of authors' names, not works, and then","Nor praise nor blame the writings, but the men.","Of all this servile herd, the worst is he","That in proud dulness joins with quality;","A constant critic at the great man's board,","To fetch and carry nonsense for my lord.","What woful stuff this madrigal would be,","In some starved hackney sonnetteer, or me?","But let a lord once own the happy lines","How the wit brightens! how the style refines!","Before his sacred name flies every fault,","And each exalted stanza teems with thought!","","The vulgar thus through imitation err;","As oft the learn'd by being singular:","So much they scorn the crowd, that if the throng","By chance go right, they purposely go wrong:","So schismatics the plain believers quit,","And are but damn'd for having too much wit.","Some praise at morning what they blame at night,","But always think the last opinion right.","A Muse by these is like a mistress used,","This hour she's idolised, the next abused;","While their weak heads, like towns unfortified,","'Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side.","Ask them the cause; they're wiser still, they say;","And still to-morrow's wiser than to-day.","We think our fathers fools, so wise we grow;","Our wiser sons, no doubt, will think us so.","Once school-divines this zealous isle o'erspread;","Who knew most sentences, was deepest read;","Faith, Gospel, all, seem'd made to be disputed,","And none had sense enough to be confuted:","Scotists and Thomists now in peace remain,","Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Duck-lane.","If Faith itself has different dresses worn,","What wonder modes in wit should take their turn?","Oft, leaving what is natural and fit,","The current folly proves the ready wit,","And authors think their reputation safe","Which lives as long as fools are pleased to laugh.","","Some valuing those of their own side or mind,","Still make themselves the measure of mankind:","Fondly we think we honour merit then,","When we but praise ourselves in other men.","Parties in wit attend on those of state,","And public faction doubles private hate.","Pride, malice, folly, against Dryden rose,","In various shapes of parsons, critics, beaux;","But sense survived, when merry jests were past;","For rising merit will buoy up at last.","Might he return, and bless once more our eyes,","New Blackmores and new Milbourns must arise:","Nay, should great Homer lift his awful head,","Zoilus again would start up from the dead.","Envy will Merit, as its shade, pursue,","But like a shadow, proves the substance true;","For envied wit, like Sol eclipsed, makes known","The opposing body's grossness, not its own.","When first that sun too powerful beams displays,","It draws up vapours which obscure its rays;","But even those clouds at last adorn its way,","Reflect new glories, and augment the day.","","Be thou the first true merit to befriend;","His praise is lost, who stays till all commend.","Short is the date, alas! of modern rhymes,","And 'tis but just to let them live betimes.","No longer now that golden age appears,","When patriarch-wits survived a thousand years:","Now length of fame (our second life) is lost,","And bare threescore is all even that can boast;","Our sons their fathers' failing language see,","And such as Chaucer is, shall Dryden be.","So when the faithful pencil has design'd","Some bright idea of the master's mind,","Where a new world leaps out at his command,","And ready Nature waits upon his hand;","When the ripe colours soften and unite,","And sweetly melt into just shade and light;","When mellowing years their full perfection give,","And each bold figure just begins to live,","The treacherous colours the fair art betray,","And all the bright creation fades away!","","Unhappy wit, like most mistaken things,","Atones not for that envy which it brings.","In youth alone its empty praise we boast,","But soon the short-lived vanity is lost:","Like some fair flower the early spring supplies,","That gaily blooms, but even in blooming dies.","What is this wit, which must our cares employ?","The owner's wife, that other men enjoy;","Then most our trouble still when most admired,","And still the more we give, the more required;","Whose fame with pains we guard, but lose with ease,","Sure some to vex, but never all to please;","'Tis what the vicious fear, the virtuous shun,","By fools 'tis hated, and by knaves undone!","","If wit so much from ignorance undergo,","Ah, let not learning too commence its foe!","Of old, those met rewards who could excel,","And such were praised who but endeavour'd well:","Though triumphs were to generals only due,","Crowns were reserved to grace the soldiers too.","Now, they who reach Parnassus' lofty crown,","Employ their pains to spurn some others down;","And while self-love each jealous writer rules,","Contending wits become the sport of fools:","But still the worst with most regret commend,","For each ill author is as bad a friend.","To what base ends, and by what abject ways,","Are mortals urged through sacred lust of praise!","Ah, ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast,","Nor in the critic let the man be lost.","Good-nature and good-sense must ever join;","To err is human--to forgive, divine.","","But if in noble minds some dregs remain,","Not yet purged off, of spleen and sour disdain;","Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes,","Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times.","No pardon vile obscenity should find,","Though wit and art conspire to move your mind;","But dulness with obscenity must prove","As shameful sure as impotence in love.","In the fat age of pleasure, wealth, and ease,","Sprung the rank weed, and thrived with large increase:","When love was all an easy monarch's care;","Seldom at council, never in a war:","Jilts ruled the state, and statesmen farces writ;","Nay, wits had pensions, and young lords had wit;","The fair sat panting at a courtier's play,","And not a mask went unimproved away:","The modest fan was lifted up no more,","And virgins smiled at what they blush'd before.","The following license of a foreign reign","Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain;","Then unbelieving priests reform'd the nation,","And taught more pleasant methods of salvation;","Where Heaven's free subjects might their rights dispute,","Lest God himself should seem too absolute:","Pulpits their sacred satire learn'd to spare,","And vice admired to find a flatterer there!","Encouraged thus, wit's Titans braved the skies,","And the press groan'd with licensed blasphemies.","These monsters, critics! with your darts engage,","Here point your thunder, and exhaust your rage!","Yet shun their fault, who, scandalously nice,","Will needs mistake an author into vice;","All seems infected that the infected spy,","As all looks yellow to the jaundiced eye.","","PART THIRD.","","Learn, then, what MORALS critics ought to show,","For 'tis but half a judge's task to know.","'Tis not enough, taste, judgment, learning join;","In all you speak, let truth and candour shine:","That not alone what to your sense is due","All may allow; but seek your friendship too.","","Be silent always when you doubt your sense;","And speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence:","Some positive, persisting fops we know,","Who, if once wrong, will needs be always so;","But you, with pleasure own your errors past,","And make each day a critique on the last.","","'Tis not enough your counsel still be true;","Blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do;","Men must be taught as if you taught them not,","And things unknown proposed as things forgot.","Without good-breeding, truth is disapproved;","That only makes superior sense beloved.","","Be niggards of advice on no pretence;","For the worst avarice is that of sense.","With mean complaisance ne'er betray your trust,","Nor be so civil as to prove unjust.","Fear not the anger of the wise to raise;","Those best can bear reproof, who merit praise.","","'Twere well might critics still this freedom take,","But Appius reddens at each word you speak,","And stares tremendous, with a threatening eye,","Like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry.","Fear most to tax an Honourable fool,","Whose right it is, uncensured, to be dull;","Such, without wit, are poets when they please,","As without learning they can take degrees.","Leave dangerous truths to unsuccessful satires,","And flattery to fulsome dedicators,","Whom, when they praise, the world believes no more,","Than when they promise to give scribbling o'er.","'Tis best sometimes your censure to restrain,","And charitably let the dull be vain:","Your silence there is better than your spite,","For who can rail so long as they can write?","Still humming on, their drowsy course they keep,","And lash'd so long, like tops, are lash'd asleep.","False steps but help them to renew the race,","As, after stumbling, jades will mend their pace.","What crowds of these, impenitently bold,","In sounds and jingling syllables grown old,","Still run on poets, in a raging vein,","Even to the dregs and squeezings of the brain,","Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense,","And rhyme with all the rage of impotence!","","Such shameless bards we have; and yet 'tis true,","There are as mad, abandon'd critics too.","The bookful blockhead, ignorantly read,","With loads of learnèd lumber in his head,","With his own tongue still edifies his ears,","And always listening to himself appears.","All books he reads, and all he reads assails,","From Dryden's Fables down to D'Urfey's Tales.","With him, most authors steal their works, or buy;","Garth did not write his own Dispensary.","Name a new play, and he's the poet's friend,","Nay, show'd his faults--but when would poets mend?","No place so sacred from such fops is barr'd,","Nor is Paul's church more safe than Paul's churchyard:","Nay, fly to altars; there they'll talk you dead:","For fools rush in where angels fear to tread.","Distrustful sense with modest caution speaks,","It still looks home, and short excursions makes;","But rattling nonsense in full volleys breaks,","And, never shock'd, and never turn'd aside,","Bursts out, resistless, with a thundering tide.","","But where's the man, who counsel can bestow,","Still pleased to teach, and yet not proud to know?","Unbiass'd, or by favour, or by spite;","Not dully prepossess'd, nor blindly right;","Though learn'd, well-bred; and though well-bred, sincere;","Modestly bold, and humanly severe:","Who to a friend his faults can freely show,","And gladly praise the merit of a foe?","Bless'd with a taste exact, yet unconfined;","A knowledge both of books and human kind;","Generous converse; a soul exempt from pride;","And love to praise, with reason on his side?","","Such once were critics; such the happy few,","Athens and Rome in better ages knew.","The mighty Stagyrite first left the shore,","Spread all his sails, and durst the deeps explore;","He steer'd securely, and discover'd far,","Led by the light of the Maeonian star.","Poets, a race long unconfined, and free,","Still fond and proud of savage liberty,","Received his laws; and stood convinced 'twas fit,","Who conquer'd Nature, should preside o'er Wit.","","Horace still charms with graceful negligence,","And without method talks us into sense,","Will, like a friend, familiarly convey","The truest notions in the easiest way.","He who, supreme in judgment, as in wit,","Might boldly censure, as he boldly writ,","Yet judged with coolness, though he sung with fire;","His precepts teach but what his works inspire.","Our critics take a contrary extreme,","They judge with fury, but they write with phlegm:","Nor suffers Horace more in wrong translations","By wits, than critics in as wrong quotations.","","See Dionysius Homer's thoughts refine,","And call new beauties forth from every line!","","Fancy and art in gay Petronius please,","The scholar's learning, with the courtier's ease.","","In grave Quintilian's copious work we find","The justest rules and clearest method join'd:","Thus useful arms in magazines we place,","All ranged in order, and disposed with grace,","But less to please the eye, than arm the hand,","Still fit for use, and ready at command.","","Thee, bold Longinus! all the Nine inspire,","And bless their critic with a poet's fire.","An ardent judge, who, zealous in his trust,","With warmth gives sentence, yet is always just;","Whose own example strengthens all his laws;","And is himself that Great Sublime he draws.","","Thus long succeeding critics justly reign'd,","Licence repress'd, and useful laws ordain'd.","Learning and Rome alike in empire grew;","And arts still follow'd where her eagles flew;","From the same foes, at last, both felt their doom,","And the same age saw Learning fall, and Rome.","With Tyranny then Superstition join'd,","As that the body, this enslaved the mind;","Much was believed, but little understood,","And to be dull was construed to be good;","A second deluge Learning thus o'errun,","And the Monks finish'd what the Goths begun.","","At length Erasmus, that great injured name,","(The glory of the priesthood, and the shame!)","Stemm'd the wild torrent of a barbarous age,","And drove those holy Vandals off the stage.","","But see! each Muse, in Leo's golden days,","Starts from her trance, and trims her wither'd bays,","Rome's ancient Genius, o'er its ruins spread,","Shakes off the dust, and rears his reverend head.","Then Sculpture and her sister-arts revive;","Stones leap'd to form, and rocks began to live;","With sweeter notes each rising temple rung:","A Raphael painted, and a Vida sung:","Immortal Vida! on whose honour'd brow","The poet's bays and critic's ivy grow;","Cremona now shall ever boast thy name,","As next in place to Mantua, next in fame!","","But soon by impious arms from Latium chased,","Their ancient bounds the banish'd Muses pass'd;","Thence Arts o'er all the northern world advance,","But critic-learning flourish'd most in France:","The rules a nation, born to serve, obeys;","And Boileau still in right of Horace sways.","But we, brave Britons, foreign laws despised,","And kept unconquer'd and uncivilised;","Fierce for the liberties of wit, and bold,","We still defied the Romans, as of old.","Yet some there were, among the sounder few","Of those who less presumed, and better knew,","Who durst assert the juster ancient cause,","And here restored Wit's fundamental laws.","Such was the Muse, whose rules and practice tell,","'Nature's chief masterpiece is writing well.'","Such was Roscommon, not more learn'd than good,","With manners generous as his noble blood;","To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known,","And every author's merit, but his own.","Such late was Walsh--the Muse's judge and friend,","Who justly knew to blame or to commend;","To failings mild, but zealous for desert;","The clearest head, and the sincerest heart.","This humble praise, lamented Shade! receive,","This praise at least a grateful Muse may give:","The Muse, whose early voice you taught to sing,","Prescribed her heights, and pruned her tender wing,","(Her guide now lost) no more attempts to rise,","But in low numbers short excursions tries:","Content, if hence the unlearn'd their wants may view,","The learn'd reflect on what before they knew:","Careless of censure, nor too fond of fame;","Still pleased to praise, yet not afraid to blame;","Averse alike to flatter, or offend;","Not free from faults, nor yet too vain to mend."],"linecount":"747"},{"title":"Hope Holds to Christ","author":"Gerard Manley Hopkins","lines":[". . . . . . . .","Hope holds to Christ the mind’s own mirror out","To take His lovely likeness

The very spot","Where many a time he triumphed is forgot.","Near yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,","Where once the signpost caught the passing eye,","Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspired,","Where grey-beard mirth and smiling toil retired,","Where village statesmen talked with looks profound,","And news much older than their ale went round.","Imagination fondly stoops to trace","The parlour splendours of that festive place:","The white-washed wall, the nicely sanded floor,","The varnished clock that clicked behind the door;","The chest contrived a double debt to pay,—","A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day;","The pictures placed for ornament and use,","The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose;","The hearth, except when winter chilled the day,","With aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel gay;","While broken teacups, wisely kept for show,","Ranged o'er the chimney, glistened in a row.","","Vain transitory splendours! Could not all","Reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall!","Obscure it sinks, nor shall it more impart","An hour's importance to the poor man's heart;","Thither no more the peasant shall repair","To sweet oblivion of his daily care;","No more the farmer's news, the barber's tale,","No more the woodman's ballad shall prevail;","No more the smith his dusky brow shall clear,","Relax his ponderous strength, and lean to hear;","The host himself no longer shall be found","Careful to see the mantling bliss go round;","Nor the coy maid, half willing to be pressed,","Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest.","","Yes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,","These simple blessings of the lowly train;","To me more dear, congenial to my heart,","One native charm, than all the gloss of art.","Spontaneous joys, where Nature has its play,","The soul adopts, and owns their first-born sway;","Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind,","Unenvied, unmolested, unconfined:","But the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,","With all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed,","In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,","The toiling pleasure sickens into pain;","And, even while fashion's brightest arts decoy,","The heart distrusting asks, if this be joy.","","Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen, who survey","The rich man's joys increase, the poor's decay,","'Tis yours to judge how wide the limits stand","Between a splendid and a happy land.","Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore,","And shouting Folly hails them from her shore;","Hoards even beyond the miser's wish abound,","And rich men flock from all the world around.","Yet count our gains. This wealth is but a name","That leaves our useful products still the same.","Not so the loss. The man of wealth and pride","Takes up a space that many poor supplied;","Space for his lake, his park's extended bounds,","Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds;","The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth","Has robbed the neighbouring fields of half their growth;","His seat, where solitary sports are seen,","Indignant spurns the cottage from the green;","Around the world each needful product flies,","For all the luxuries the world supplies:","While thus the land adorned for pleasure, all","In barren splendour feebly waits the fall.","","As some fair female unadorned and plain,","Secure to please while youth confirms her reign,","Slights every borrowed charm that dress supplies,","Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes;","But when those charms are passed, for charms are frail,","When time advances and when lovers fail,","She then shines forth, solicitous to bless,","In all the glaring impotence of dress.","Thus fares the land, by luxury betrayed,","In nature's simplest charms at first arrayed;","But verging to decline, its splendours rise,","Its vistas strike, its palaces surprise;","While, scourged by famine, from the smiling land","The mournful peasant leads his humble band;","And while he sinks, without one arm to save,","The country blooms—a garden, and a grave.","","Where then, ah! where, shall poverty reside,","To 'scape the pressure of contiguous pride?","If to some common's fenceless limits strayed,","He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade,","Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide,","And even the bare-worn common is denied.","If to the city sped—what waits him there?","To see profusion that he must not share;","To see ten thousand baneful arts combined","To pamper luxury, and thin mankind;","To see those joys the sons of pleasure know","Extorted from his fellow creature's woe.","Here, while the courtier glitters in brocade,","There the pale artist plies the sickly trade;","Here, while the proud their long-drawn pomps display,","There the black gibbet glooms beside the way.","The dome where Pleasure holds her midnight reign","Here, richly decked, admits the gorgeous train;","Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square,","The rattling chariots clash, the torches glare.","Sure scenes like these no troubles e'er annoy!","Sure these denote one universal joy!","Are these thy serious thoughts?—Ah, turn thine eyes","Where the poor houseless shivering female lies.","She once, perhaps, in a village plenty blessed,","Has wept at tales of innocence distressed;","Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,","Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn;","Now lost to all; her friends, her virtue fled,","Near her betrayer's door she lays her head,","And, pinched with cold, and shrinking from the shower,","With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour,","When idly first, ambitious of the town,","She left her wheel and robes of country brown.","","Do thine, sweet Auburn, thine, the loveliest train,","Do thy fair tribes participate her pain?","E'en now, perhaps, by cold and hunger led,","At proud men's doors they ask a little bread!","","Ah, no!—To distant climes, a dreary scene,","Where half the convex world intrudes between,","Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go,","Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe.","Far different there from all that charmed before,","The various terrors of that horrid shore;","Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray","And fiercely shed intolerable day;","Those matted woods where birds forget to sing,","But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling;","Those poisonous fields with rank luxuriance crowned,","Where the dark scorpion gathers death around;","Where at each step the stranger fears to wake","The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake;","Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey,","And savage men more murderous still than they;","While oft in whirls the mad tornado flies,","Mingling the ravaged landscape with the skies.","Far different these from every former scene,","The cooling brook, the grassy-vested green,","The breezy covert of the warbling grove,","That only sheltered thefts of harmless love.","","Good Heaven! what sorrows gloomed that parting day","That called them from their native walks away;","When the poor exiles, every pleasure passed,","Hung round their bowers, and fondly looked their last,","And took a long farewell, and wished in vain","For seats like these beyond the western main;","And, shuddering still to face the distant deep,","Returned and wept, and still returned to weep.","The good old sire, the first prepared to go","To new-found worlds, and wept for others' woe;","But for himself, in conscious virtue brave,","He only wished for worlds beyond the grave.","His lovely daughter, lovelier in her tears,","The fond companion of his helpless years,","Silent went next, neglectful of her charms,","And left a lover's for a father's arms.","With louder plaints the mother spoke her woes,","And blessed the cot where every pleasure rose;","And kissed her thoughtless babes with many a tear,","And clasped them close, in sorrow doubly dear;","Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief","In all the silent manliness of grief.","","O luxury! thou cursed by Heaven's decree,","How ill exchanged are things like these for thee!","How do thy potions, with insidious joy,","Diffuse thy pleasures only to destroy!","Kingdoms by thee, to sickly greatness grown,","Boast of a florid vigour not their own;","At every draught more large and large they grow,","A bloated mass of rank unwieldly woe;","Till, sapped their strength, and every part unsound,","Down, down they sink, and spread the ruin round.","","Even now the devastation is begun,","And half the business of destruction done;","Even now, methinks, as pondering here I stand,","I see the rural virtues leave the land:","Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail","That idly waiting flaps with every gale,","Downward they move, a melancholy band,","Pass from the shore, and darken all the strand.","Contented toil, and hospitable care,","And kind connubial tenderness, are there;","And piety with wishes placed above,","And steady loyalty, and faithful love.","And thou, sweet Poetry, thou loveliest maid,","Still first to fly where sensual joys invade;","Unfit in these degenerate times of shame","To catch the heart, or strike for honest fame;","Dear charming nymph, neglected and decried,","My shame in crowds, my solitary pride;","Thou source of all my bliss, and all my woe,","That found'st me poor at first, and keep'st me so;","Thou guide by which the nobler arts excel,","Thou nurse of every virtue, fare thee well!","Farewell, and oh!

succeeding Suns:","And still the Day which he doth next restore,","Is the just Wonder of the Day before.","Cromwell alone doth with new Lustre spring,","And shines the Jewel of the yearly Ring.","'Tis he the force of scatter'd Time contracts,","And in one Year the Work of Ages acts:","While heavy Monarchs make a wide Return,","Longer, and more Malignant then Saturn:","And though they all Platonique years should raign,","In the same Posture would be found again.","Their earthly Projects under ground they lay,","More slow and brittle then the China clay:","Well may they strive to leave them to their Son,","For one Thing never was by one King don.","Yet some more active for a Frontier Town","Took in by Proxie, beggs a false Renown;","Another triumphs at the publick Cost,","And will have Wonn, if he no more have Lost;","They fight by Others, but in Person wrong,","And only are against their Subjects strong;","Their other Wars seem but a feign'd contest,","This Common Enemy is still opprest;","If Conquerors, on them they turn their might;","If Conquered, on them they wreak their Spight:","They neither build the Temple in their dayes,","Nor Matter for succeeding Founders raise;","Nor Sacred Prophecies consult within,","Much less themselves to perfect them begin,","No other care they bear of things above,","But with Astrologers divine, and Jove,","To know how long

state of Things,","Then wooden Heads unto the Viols strings,","While indefatigable Cromwell hyes,","And cuts his way still nearer to the Skyes,","Learning a Musique in the Region clear,","To tune this lower to that higher Sphere.","So when Amphion did the Lute command,","Which the God gave him, with his gentle hand,","The rougher Stones, unto his Measures hew'd,","Dans'd up in order from the Quarreys rude;","This took a Lower, that an Higher place,","As he the Treble alter'd, or the Base:","No Note he struck, but a new Story lay'd,","And the great Work ascended while he play'd.","The listning Structures he with Wonder ey'd,","And still new Stopps to various Time apply'd:","Now through the Strings a Martial rage he throws,","And joyng streight the Theban Tow'r arose;","Then as he strokes them with a Touch more sweet,","The flocking Marbles in a Palace meet;","But, for he most the graver Notes did try,","Therefore the Temples rear'd their Columns high:","Thus, ere he ceas'd, his sacred Lute creates","Th'harmonious City of the seven Gates.","Such was that wondrous Order and Consent,","When Cromwell tun'd the ruling Instrument;","While tedious Statesmen many years did hack,","Framing a Liberty that still went back;","Whose num'rous Gorge could swallow in an hour","That Island, which the Sea cannot devour:","Then our Amphion issues out and sings,","And once he struck, and twice, the pow'rful Strings.","The Commonwealth then first together came,","And each one enter'd in the willing Frame;","All other Matter yields, and may be rul'd;","But who the Minds of stubborn Men can build?","No Quarry bears a Stone so hardly wrought,","Nor with such labour from its Center brought;","None to be sunk in the Foundation bends,","Each in the House the highest Place contends,","And each the Hand that lays him will direct,","And some fall back upon the Architect;","Yet all compos'd by his attractive Song,","Into the Animated City throng.","The Common-wealth does through their Centers all","Draw the Circumf'rence of the publique Wall;","The crossest Spirits here do take their part,","Fast'ning the Contignation which they thwart;","And they, whose Nature leads them to divide,","Uphold, this one, and that the other Side;","But the most Equal still sustein the Height,","And they as Pillars keep the Work upright;","While the resistance of opposed Minds,","The Fabrick as with Arches stronger binds,","Which on the Basis of a Senate free,","Knit by the Roofs Protecting weight agree.","When for his foot he thus a place had found,","He hurles e'r since the World about him round,","And in his sev'ral Aspects, like a Star,","Here shines in Peace, and thither shoots a War.","While by his Beams observing Princes steer,","And wisely court the Influence they fear,","O would they rather by his Pattern won.","Kiss the approaching, nor yet angry Son;","And in their numbred Footsteps humbly tread","The path where holy Oracles do lead;","How might they under such a Captain raise","The great Designs kept for the latter Dayes!","But mad with reason, so miscall'd, of State","They know them not, and what they know not, hate","Hence still they sing Hosanna to the Whore,","And her whom they should Massacre adore:","But Indians whom they should convert, subdue;","Nor teach, but traffique with, or burn the Jew.","Unhappy Princes, ignorantly bred,","By Malice some, by Errour more misled;","If gracious Heaven to my Life give length,","Leisure to Times, and to my Weakness Strength,","Then shall I once with graver Accents shake","Your Regal sloth, and your long Slumbers wake:","Like the shrill Huntsman that prevents the East,","Winding his Horn to Kings that chase the Beast.","Till then my Muse shall hollow far behind","Angelique Cromwell who outwings the wind;","And in dark Nights, and in cold Dayes alone","Pursues the Monster thorough every Throne:","Which shrinking to her Roman Den impure,","Gnashes her Goary teeth; nor there secure.","Hence oft I think, if in some happy Hour","High Grace should meet in one with highest Pow'r,","And then a seasonable People still","Should bend to his, as he to Heavens will,","What we might hope, what wonderful Effect","From such a wish'd Conjuncture might reflect.","Sure, the mysterious Work, where none withstand,","Would forthwith finish under such a Hand:","Fore-shortned Time its useless Course would stay,","And soon precipitate the latest Day.","But a thick Cloud about that Morning lyes,","And intercepts the Beams of Mortal eyes,","That 'tis the most which we deteremine can,","If these the Times, then this must be the Man.","And well he therefore does, and well has guest,","Who in his Age has always forward prest:","And knowing not where Heavens choice may light,","Girds yet his Sword, and ready stands to fight;","But Men alas, as if they nothing car'd,","Look on, all unconcern'd, or unprepar'd;","And Stars still fall, and still the Dragons Tail","Swinges the Volumes of its horrid Flail.","For the great Justice that did first suspend","The World by Sin, does by the same extend.","Hence that blest Day still counterpoysed wastes,","The ill delaying, what th'Elected hastes;","Hence landing Nature to new Seas it tost,","And good Designes still with their Authors lost.","And thou, great Cromwell, for whose happy birth","A Mold was chosen out of better Earth;","Whose Saint-like Mother we did lately see","Live out an Age, long as a Pedigree;","That she might seem, could we the Fall dispute,","T'have smelt the Blossome, and not eat the Fruit;","Though none does of more lasting Parents grow,","But never any did them Honor so;","Though thou thine Heart from Evil still unstain'd,","And always hast thy Tongue from fraud refrain'd,","Thou, who so oft through Storms of thundring Lead","Hast born securely thine undaunted Head,","Thy Brest through ponyarding Conspiracies,","Drawn from the Sheath of lying Prophecies;","Thee proof beyond all other Force or Skill,","Our Sins endanger, and shall one day kill.","How near they fail'd, and in thy sudden Fall","At once assay'd to overturn us all.","Our brutish fury strugling to be Free,","Hurry'd thy Horses while they hurry'd thee.","When thou hadst almost quit thy Mortal cares,","And soyl'd in Dust thy Crown of silver Hairs.","Let this one Sorrow interweave among","The other Glories of our yearly Song.","Like skilful Looms which through the costly threed","Of purling Ore, a shining wave do shed:","So shall the Tears we on past Grief employ,","Still as they trickle, glitter in our Joy.","So with more Modesty we may be True,","And speak as of the Dead the Praises due:","While impious Men deceiv'd with pleasure short,","On their own Hopes shall find the Fall retort.","But the poor Beasts wanting their noble Guide,","What could they move? shrunk guiltily aside.","First winged Fear transports them far away,","And leaden Sorrow then their flight did stay.","See how they each his towring Crest abate,","And the green Grass, and their known Mangers hate,","Nor through wide Nostrils snuffe the wanton air,","Nor their round Hoofs, or curled Mane'scompare;","With wandring Eyes, and restless Ears theystood,","And with shrill Neighings ask'd him of the Wood.","Thou Cromwell falling, not a stupid Tree,","Or Rock so savage, but it mourn'd for thee:","And all about was heard a Panique groan,","As if that Natures self were overthrown.","It seem'd the Earth did from the Center tear;","It seem'd the Sun was faln out of the Sphere:","Justice obstructed lay, and Reason fool'd;","Courage disheartned, and Religion cool'd.","A dismal Silence through the Palace went,","And then loud Shreeks the vaulted Marbles rent.","Such as the dying Chorus sings by turns,","And to deaf Seas, and ruthless Tempests mourns,","When now they sink, and now the plundring Streams","Break up each Deck, and rip the Oaken seams.","But thee triumphant hence the firy Carr,","And firy Steeds had born out of the Warr,","From the low World, and thankless Men above,","Unto the Kingdom blest of Peace and Love:","We only mourn'd our selves, in thine Ascent,","Whom thou hadst lest beneath with Mantle rent.","For all delight of Life thou then didst lose,","When to Command, thou didst thy self Depose;","Resigning up thy Privacy so dear,","To turn the headstrong Peoples Charioteer;","For to be Cromwell was a greater thing,","Then ought below, or yet above a King:","Therefore thou rather didst thy Self depress,","Yielding to Rule, because it made thee Less.","For, neither didst thou from the first apply","Thy sober Spirit unto things too High,","But in thine own Fields exercisedst long,","An Healthful Mind within a Body strong;","Till at the Seventh time thou in the Skyes,","As a small Cloud, like a Mans hand didst rise;","Then did thick Mists and Winds the air deform,","And down at last thou pow'rdst the fertile Storm;","Which to the thirsty Land did plenty bring,","But though forewarn'd, o'r-took and wet the King.","What since he did, an higher Force him push'd","Still from behind, and it before him rush'd,","Though undiscern'd among the tumult blind,","Who think those high Decrees by Man design'd.","'Twas Heav'n would not that his Pow'r should cease,","But walk still middle betwixt War and Peace;","Choosing each Stone, and poysing every weight,","Trying the Measures of the Bredth and Height;","Here pulling down, and there erecting New,","Founding a firm State by Proportions true.","When Gideon so did from the War retreat,","Yet by Conquest of two Kings grown great,","He on the Peace extends a Warlike power,","And Is'rel silent saw him rase the Tow'r;","And how he Succoths Elders durst suppress,","With Thorns and Briars of the Wilderness.","No King

shake,","And make the World, by his Example, Quake:","Whose frantique Army should they want for Men","Might muster Heresies, so one were ten.","What thy Misfortune, they the Spirit call,","And their Religion only is to Fall.","Oh Mahomet! now couldst thou rise again,","Thy Falling-sickness should have made thee Reign,","While Feake and Simpson would in many a Tome,","Have writ the Comments of thy

Scriptures and the Laws deface","With the same liberty as Points and Lace;","Oh Race most hypocritically strict!","Bent to reduce us to the ancient Pict;","Well may you act the Adam and the Eve;","Ay, and the Serpent too that did deceive.","But the great Captain, now the danger's ore,","Makes you for his sake Tremble one fit more;","And, to your spight, returning yet alive","Does with himself all that is good revive.","So when first Man did through the Morning new","See the bright Sun his shining Race pursue,","All day he follow'd with unwearied sight,","Pleas'd with that other World of moving Light;","But thought him when he miss'd his setting beams,","Sunk in the Hills, or plung'd below the Streams.","While dismal blacks hung round the Universe,","And Stars (like Tapers) burn'd upon his Herse:","And Owls and Ravens with their screeching noyse","Did make the Fun'rals sadder by their Joyes.","His weeping Eyes the doleful Vigils keep,","Not knowing yet the Night was made for sleep:","Still to the West, where he him lost, he turn'd,","And with such accents, as Despairing, mourn'd:","Why did mine Eyes once see so bright a Ray;","Or why Day last no longer than a Day?","When streight the Sun behind him he descry'd,","Smiling serenely from the further side.","So while our Star that gives us Light and Heat,","Seem'd now a long and gloomy Night to threat,","Up from the other World his Flame he darts,","And Princes shining through their windows starts;","Who their suspected Counsellors refuse,","And credulous Ambassadors accuse.","\"Is this, saith one, the Nation that we read","\"Spent with both Wars, under a Captain dead?","\"Yet rig a Navy while we dress us late;","\"And ere we Dine, rase and rebuild our State.","\"What Oaken Forrests, and what golden Mines!","\"What Mints of Men, what Union of Designes!","\"Unless their Ships, do, as their Fowle proceed","\"Of shedding Leaves, that with their Ocean breed.","\"Theirs are not Ships, but rather Arks of War,","\"And beaked Promontories sail'd from far;","\"Of floting Islands a new Hatched Nest;","\"A Fleet of Worlds, of other Worlds in quest;","\"An hideous shole of wood Leviathans,","\"Arm'd with three Tire of brazen Hurricans;","\"That through the Center shoot their thundring side","\"And sink the Earth that does at Anchor ride.","'What refuge to escape them can be found,","\"Whose watry

wondrous beauty, breathing sweet delights","Do kindle love in high-conceited sprights;","I fain to tell the things that I behold,","But feel my wits to fail, and tongue to fold.","","Vouchsafe then, O thou most Almighty Spright,","From whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow,","To shed into my breast some sparkling light","Of thine eternal truth, that I may show","Some little beams to mortal eyes below","Of that immortal beauty, there with thee,","Which in my weak distraughted mind I see;","","That with the glory of so goodly sight","The hearts of men, which fondly here admire","Fair seeming shews, and feed on vain delight,","Transported with celestial desire","Of those fair forms, may lift themselves up higher,","And learn to love, with zealous humble duty,","Th' eternal fountain of that heavenly beauty.","","Beginning then below, with th' easy view","Of this base world, subject to fleshly eye,","From thence to mount aloft, by order due,","To contemplation of th' immortal sky;","Of the soare falcon so I learn to fly,","That flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath,","Till she herself for stronger flight can breathe.","","Then look, who list thy gazeful eyes to feed","With sight of that is fair, look on the frame","Of this wide universe, and therein reed","The endless kinds of creatures which by name","Thou canst not count, much less their natures aim;","All which are made with wondrous wise respect,","And all with admirable beauty deckt.","","First th' earth, on adamantine pillars founded,","Amid the sea engirt with brazen bands;","Then th' air still flitting, but yet firmly bounded","On every side, with piles of flaming brands,","Never consum'd, nor quench'd with mortal hands;","And last, that mighty shining crystal wall,","Wherewith he hath encompassed this All.","","By view whereof it plainly may appear,","That still as every thing doth upward tend,","And further is from earth, so still more clear","And fair it grows, till to his perfect end","Of purest beauty it at last ascend;","Air more than water, fire much more than air,","And heaven than fire, appears more pure and fair.","","Look thou no further, but affix thine eye","On that bright, shiny, round, still moving mass,","The house of blessed gods, which men call sky,","All sow'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass,","Whereof each other doth in brightness pass,","But those two most, which ruling night and day,","As king and queen, the heavens' empire sway;","","And tell me then, what hast thou ever seen","That to their beauty may compared be,","Or can the sight that is most sharp and keen","Endure their captain's flaming head to see?","How much less those, much higher in degree,","And so much fairer, and much more than these,","As these are fairer than the land and seas?","","For far above these heavens, which here we see,","Be others far exceeding these in light,","Not bounded, not corrupt, as these same be,","But infinite in largeness and in height,","Unmoving, uncorrupt, and spotless bright,","That need no sun t' illuminate their spheres,","But their own native light far passing theirs.","","And as these heavens still by degrees arise,","Until they come to their first Mover's bound,","That in his mighty compass doth comprise,","And carry all the rest with him around;","So those likewise do by degrees redound,","And rise more fair; till they at last arrive","To the most fair, whereto they all do strive.","","Fair is the heaven where happy souls have place,","In full enjoyment of felicity,","Whence they do still behold the glorious face","Of the divine eternal Majesty;","More fair is that, where those Ideas on high","Enranged be, which Plato so admired,","And pure Intelligences from God inspired.","","Yet fairer is that heaven, in which do reign","The sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates,","Which in their high protections do contain","All mortal princes and imperial states;","And fairer yet, whereas the royal Seats","And heavenly Dominations are set,","From whom all earthly governance is fet.","","Yet far more fair be those bright Cherubins,","Which all with golden wings are overdight,","And those eternal burning Seraphins,","Which from their faces dart out fiery light;","Yet fairer than they both, and much more bright,","Be th' Angels and Archangels, which attend","On God's own person, without rest or end.","","These thus in fair each other far excelling,","As to the highest they approach more near,","Yet is that highest far beyond all telling,","Fairer than all the rest which there appear,","Though all their beauties join'd together were;","How then can mortal tongue hope to express","The image of such endless perfectness?","","Cease then, my tongue, and lend unto my mind","Leave to bethink how great that beauty is,","Whose utmost parts so beautiful I find;","How much more those essential parts of his,","His truth, his love, his wisdom, and his bliss,","His grace, his doom, his mercy, and his might,","By which he lends us of himself a sight.","","Those unto all he daily doth display,","And shew himself in th' image of his grace,","As in a looking-glass, through which he may","Be seen of all his creatures vile and base,","That are unable else to see his face,","His glorious face which glistereth else so bright,","That th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.","","But we, frail wights, whose sight cannot sustain","The sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine,","But that their points rebutted back again","Are dull'd, how can we see with feeble eyne","The glory of that Majesty Divine,","In sight of whom both sun and moon are dark,","Compared to his least resplendent spark?","","The means, therefore, which unto us is lent","Him to behold, is on his works to look,","Which he hath made in beauty excellent,","And in the same, as in a brazen book,","To read enregister'd in every nook","His goodness, which his beauty doth declare;","For all that's good is beautiful and fair.","","Thence gathering plumes of perfect speculation,","To imp the wings of thy high-flying mind,","Mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation,","From this dark world, whose damps the soul so blind,","And, like the native brood of eagles' kind,","On that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes,","Clear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.","","Humbled with fear and awful reverence,","Before the footstool of his majesty","Throw thyself down, with trembling innocence,","Ne dare look up with corruptible eye","On the dread face of that great Deity,","For fear, lest if he chance to look on thee,","Thou turn to nought, and quite confounded be.","","But lowly fall before his mercy seat,","Close covered with the Lamb's integrity","From the just wrath of his avengeful threat","That sits upon the righteous throne on high;","His throne is built upon eternity,","More firm and durable than steel or brass,","Or the hard diamond, which them both doth pass.","","His sceptre is the rod of righteousness,","With which he bruiseth all his foes to dust,","And the great Dragon strongly doth repress,","Under the rigour of his judgement just;","His seat is truth, to which the faithful trust,","From whence proceed her beams so pure and bright","That all about him sheddeth glorious light:","","Light far exceeding that bright blazing spark","Which darted is from Titan's flaming head,","That with his beams enlumineth the dark","And dampish air, whereby all things are read;","Whose nature yet so much is marvelled","Of mortal wits, that it doth much amaze","The greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.","","But that immortal light, which there doth shine,","Is many thousand times more bright, more clear,","More excellent, more glorious, more divine,","Through which to God all mortal actions here,","And even the thoughts of men, do plain appear;","For from th' eternal truth it doth proceed,","Through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.","","With the great glory of that wondrous light","His throne is all encompassed around,","And hid in his own brightness from the sight","Of all that look thereon with eyes unsound;","And underneath his feet are to be found","Thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire,","The instruments of his avenging ire.","","There in his bosom Sapience doth sit,","The sovereign darling of the Deity,","Clad like a queen in royal robes, most fit","For so great power and peerless majesty,","And all with gems and jewels gorgeously","Adorn'd, that brighter than the stars appear,","And make her native brightness seem more clear.","","And on her head a crown of purest gold","Is set, in sign of highest sovereignty;","And in her hand a sceptre she doth hold,","With which she rules the house of God on high,","And manageth the ever-moving sky,","And in the same these lower creatures all","Subjected to her power imperial.","","Both heaven and earth obey unto her will,","And all the creatures which they both contain;","For of her fullness which the world doth fill","They all partake, and do in state remain","As their great Maker did at first ordain,","Through observation of her high behest,","By which they first were made, and still increast.","","The fairness of her face no tongue can tell;","For she the daughters of all women's race,","And angels eke, in beauty doth excel,","Sparkled on her from God's own glorious face,","And more increas'd by her own goodly grace,","That it doth far exceed all human thought,","Ne can on earth compared be to aught.","","Ne could that painter (had he lived yet)","Which pictured Venus with so curious quill,","That all posterity admired it,","Have portray'd this, for all his mast'ring skill;","Ne she herself, had she remained still,","And were as fair as fabling wits do feign,","Could once come near this beauty sovereign.","","But had those wits, the wonders of their days,","Or that sweet Teian poet, which did spend","His plenteous vein in setting forth her praise,","Seen but a glimpse of this which I pretend,","How wondrously would he her face commend,","Above that idol of his feigning thought,","That all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.","","How then dare I, the novice of his art,","Presume to picture so divine a wight,","Or hope t' express her least perfection's part,","Whose beauty fills the heavens with her light,","And darks the earth with shadow of her sight?","Ah, gentle Muse, thou art too weak and faint","The portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.","","Let angels, which her goodly face behold","And see at will, her sovereign praises sing,","And those most sacred mysteries unfold","Of that fair love of mighty heaven's King;","Enough is me t' admire so heavenly thing,","And being thus with her huge love possest,","In th' only wonder of herself to rest.","","But whoso may, thrice happy man him hold,","Of all on earth whom God so much doth grace","And lets his own beloved to behold;","For in the view of her celestial face","All joy, all bliss, all happiness, have place;","Ne aught on earth can want unto the wight","Who of herself can win the wishful sight.","","For she, out of her secret treasury,","Plenty of riches forth on him will pour,","Even heavenly riches, which there hidden lie","Within the closet of her chastest bower,","Th' eternal portion of her precious dower,","Which mighty God hath given to her free,","And to all those which thereof worthy be.","","None thereof worthy be, but those whom she","Vouchsafeth to her presence to receive,","And letteth them her lovely face to see,","Whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive,","And sweet contentment, that it doth bereave","Their soul of sense, through infinite delight,","And them transport from flesh into the spright.","","In which they see such admirable things,","As carries them into an ecstasy,","And hear such heavenly notes, and carollings","Of God's high praise, that fills the brazen sky;","And feel such joy and pleasure inwardly,","That maketh them all worldly cares forget,","And only think on that before them set.","","Ne from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense,","Or idle thought of earthly things, remain;","But all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence,","And all that pleased erst now seems to pain;","Their joy, their comfort, their desire, their gain,","Is fixed all on that which now they see;","All other sights but feigned shadows be.","","And that fair lamp, which useth to inflame","The hearts of men with self-consuming fire","Thenceforth seems foul, and

\"peelew\"","  On Royce Wood seemed a sweeter tune.","","I walk adown the narrow lane,","  The nightingale is singing now,","But like to me she seems at loss","  For Royce Wood and its shielding bough.","I lean upon the window sill,","  The trees and summer happy seem;","Green, sunny green they shine, but still","  My heart goes far away to dream.","","Of happiness, and thoughts arise","  With home-bred pictures many a one,","Green lanes that shut out burning skies","  And old crooked stiles to rest upon;","Above them hangs the maple tree,","  Below grass swells a velvet hill,","And little footpaths sweet to see","  Go seeking sweeter places still,","","With bye and bye a brook to cross","  Oer which a little arch is thrown:","No brook is here, I feel the loss","  From home and

they seem in deader green,","The sun een seems to lose its way","  Nor knows the quarter it is in.","","I dwell in trifles like a child,","  I feel as ill becomes a man,","And still my thoughts like weedlings wild","  Grow up to blossom where they can.","They turn to places known so long","  I feel that joy was dwelling there,","So home-fed pleasure fills the song","  That has no present joys to hear.","","I read in books for happiness,","  But books are like the sea to joy,","They change--as well give age the glass","  To hunt its visage when a boy.","For books they follow fashions new","  And throw all old esteems away,","In crowded streets flowers never grew,","  But many there hath died away.","","Some sing the pomps of chivalry","  As legends of the ancient time,","Where gold and pearls and mystery","  Are shadows painted for sublime;","But passions of sublimity","  Belong to plain and simpler things,","And David underneath a tree","  Sought when a shepherd Salem's springs,","","Where moss did into cushions spring,","  Forming a seat of velvet hue,","A small unnoticed trifling thing","  To all but heaven's hailing dew.","And David's crown hath passed away,","  Yet poesy breathes his shepherd-skill,","His palace lost--and to this day","  The little moss is blossoming still.","","Strange scenes mere shadows are to me,","  Vague impersonifying things;","I love

singing moods.","","Here every tree is strange to me,","  All foreign things where eer I go,","There's none where boyhood made a swee","  Or clambered up to rob a crow.","No hollow tree or woodland bower","  Well known when joy was beating high,","Where beauty ran to shun a shower","  And love took pains to keep her dry,","","And laid the sheaf upon the ground","  To keep her from the dripping grass,","And ran for stocks and set them round","  Till scarce a drop of rain could pass","Through; where the maidens they reclined","  And sung sweet ballads now forgot,","Which brought sweet memories to the mind,","  But here no memory knows them not.","","There have I sat by many a tree","  And leaned oer many a rural stile,","And conned my thoughts as joys to me,","  Nought heeding who might frown or smile.","Twas nature's beauty that inspired","  My heart with rapture not its own,","And she's a fame that never tires;","  How could I feel myself alone?","","No, pasture molehills used to lie","  And talk to me of sunny days,","And then the glad sheep resting bye","  All still in ruminating praise","Of summer and the pleasant place","  And every weed and blossom too","Was looking upward in my face","  With friendship's welcome \"how do ye do?\"","","All tenants of an ancient place","  And heirs of noble heritage,","Coeval they with Adam's race","  And blest with more substantial age.","For when the world first saw the sun","  These little flowers beheld him too,","And when his love for earth begun","  They were the first his smiles to woo.","","There little

wreathed with may","  The firstlings of his little flock,","And Eve might from the matted thorn","  To deck her lone and lovely brow","Reach that same rose that heedless scorn","  Misnames as the dog rosey now.","","Give me no high-flown fangled things,","  No haughty pomp in marching chime,","Where muses play on golden strings","  And splendour passes for sublime,","Where cities stretch as far as fame","  And fancy's straining eye can go,","And piled until the sky for shame","  Is stooping far away below.","","I love the verse that mild and bland","  Breathes of green fields and open sky,","I love the muse that in her hand","  Bears flowers of native poesy;","Who walks nor skips the pasture brook","  In scorn, but by the drinking horse","Leans oer its little brig to look","    How far the sallows lean across,","","And feels a rapture in her breast","  Upon their root-fringed grains to mark","A hermit morehen's sedgy nest","  Just like a naiad's summer bark.","She counts the eggs she

that saw him did enchant the mind,","For on his visage was in little drawn","What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.","","'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;","His phoenix down began but to appear","Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin","Whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear:","Yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;","And nice affections wavering stood in doubt","If best were as it was, or best without.","","'His qualities were beauteous as his form,","For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;","Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm","As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,","When winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be.","His rudeness so with his authorized youth","Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.","","'Well could he ride, and often men would say","'That horse his mettle from his rider takes:","Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,","What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop","he makes!'","And controversy hence a question takes,","Whether the horse by him became his deed,","Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.","","'But quickly on this side the verdict went:","His real habitude gave life and grace","To appertainings and to ornament,","Accomplish'd in himself, not in his case:","All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,","Came for additions; yet their purposed trim","Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.","","'So on the tip of his subduing tongue","All kinds of arguments and question deep,","All replication prompt, and reason strong,","For his advantage still did wake and sleep:","To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,","He had the dialect and different skill,","Catching all passions in his craft of will:","","'That he did in the general bosom reign","Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,","To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain","In personal duty, following where he haunted:","Consents bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted;","And dialogued for him what he would say,","Ask'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.","","'Many there were that did his picture get,","To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;","Like fools that in th' imagination set","The goodly objects which abroad they find","Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd;","And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them","Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:","","'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,","Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.","My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,","And was my own fee-simple, not in part,","What with his art in youth, and youth in art,","Threw my affections in his charmed power,","Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.","","'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,","Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;","Finding myself in honour so forbid,","With safest distance I mine honour shielded:","Experience for me many bulwarks builded","Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil","Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.","","'But, ah, who ever shunn'd by precedent","The destined ill she must herself assay?","Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,","To put the by-past perils in her way?","Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;","For when we rage, advice is often seen","By blunting us to make our wits more keen.","","'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,","That we must curb it upon others' proof;","To be forbod the sweets that seem so good,","For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.","O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!","The one a palate hath that needs will taste,","Though Reason weep, and cry, 'It is thy last.'","","'For further I could say 'This man's untrue,'","And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;","Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,","Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;","Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;","Thought characters and words merely but art,","And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.","","'And long upon these terms I held my city,","Till thus he gan besiege me: 'Gentle maid,","Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,","And be not of my holy vows afraid:","That's to ye sworn to none was ever said;","For feasts of love I have been call'd unto,","Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.","","''All my offences that abroad you see","Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;","Love made them not: with acture they may be,","Where neither party is nor true nor kind:","They sought their shame that so their shame did find;","And so much less of shame in me remains,","By how much of me their reproach contains.","","''Among the many that mine eyes have seen,","Not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd,","Or my affection put to the smallest teen,","Or any of my leisures ever charm'd:","Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harm'd;","Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,","And reign'd, commanding in his monarchy.","","''Look here, what tributes wounded fancies sent me,","Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;","Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me","Of grief and blushes, aptly understood","In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;","Effects of terror and dear modesty,","Encamp'd in hearts, but fighting outwardly.","","''And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,","With twisted metal amorously impleach'd,","I have received from many a several fair,","Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,","With the annexions of fair gems enrich'd,","And deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify","Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.","","''The diamond,--why, 'twas beautiful and hard,","Whereto his invised properties did tend;","The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard","Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;","The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend","With objects manifold: each several stone,","With wit well blazon'd, smiled or made some moan.","","''Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,","Of pensived and subdued desires the tender,","Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,","But yield them up where I myself must render,","That is, to you, my origin and ender;","For these, of force, must your oblations be,","Since I their altar, you enpatron me.","","''O, then, advance of yours that phraseless hand,","Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;","Take all these similes to your own command,","Hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;","What me your minister, for you obeys,","Works under you; and to your audit comes","Their distract parcels in combined sums.","","''Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,","Or sister sanctified, of holiest note;","Which late her noble suit in court did shun,","Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;","For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,","But kept cold distance, and did thence remove,","To spend her living in eternal love.","","''But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave","The thing we have not, mastering what not strives,","Playing the place which did no form receive,","Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?","She that her fame so to herself contrives,","The scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight,","And makes her absence valiant, not her might.","","''O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:","The accident which brought me to her eye","Upon the moment did her force subdue,","And now she would the caged cloister fly:","Religious love put out Religion's eye:","Not to be tempted, would she be immured,","And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.","","''How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!","The broken bosoms that to me belong","Have emptied all their fountains in my well,","And mine I pour your ocean all among:","I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,","Must for your victory us all congest,","As compound love to physic your cold breast.","","''My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,","Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,","Believed her eyes when they to assail begun,","All vows and consecrations giving place:","O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,","In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,","For thou art all, and all things else are thine.","","''When thou impressest, what are precepts worth","Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,","How coldly those impediments stand forth","Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!","Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense,","'gainst shame,","And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,","The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.","","''Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,","Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;","And supplicant their sighs to you extend,","To leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine,","Lending soft audience to my sweet design,","And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath","That shall prefer and undertake my troth.'","","'This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,","Whose sights till then were levell'd on my face;","Each cheek a river running from a fount","With brinish current downward flow'd apace:","O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!","Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses","That flame through water which their hue encloses.","","'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies","In the small orb of one particular tear!","But with the inundation of the eyes","What rocky heart to water will not wear?","What breast so cold that is not warmed here?","O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,","Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.","","'For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,","Even there resolved my reason into tears;","There my white stole of chastity I daff'd,","Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;","Appear to him, as he to me appears,","All melting; though our drops this difference bore,","His poison'd me, and mine did him restore.","","'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,","Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,","Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,","Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,","In either's aptness, as it best deceives,","To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes,","Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.","","'That not a heart which in his level came","Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,","Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;","And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:","Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;","When he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,","He preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.","","'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace","The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;","That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,","Which like a cherubin above them hover'd.","Who, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?","Ay me!

Death thou hast seen","In his first shape on Man; but many shapes","Of Death, and many are the ways that lead","To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense","More terrible at the entrance, than within.","Some, as thou sawest, by violent stroke shall die;","By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more","In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall bring","Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew","Before thee shall appear; that thou mayest know","What misery the inabstinence of Eve","Shall bring on Men.  Immediately a place","Before his eyes appeared, sad, noisome, dark;","A lazar-house it seemed; wherein were laid","Numbers of all diseased; all maladies","Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms","Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds,","Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs,","Intestine stone and ulcer, colick-pangs,","Demoniack phrenzy, moaping melancholy,","And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,","Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence,","Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums.","Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair","Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch;","And over them triumphant Death his dart","Shook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked","With vows, as their chief good, and final hope.","Sight so deform what heart of rock could long","Dry-eyed behold?  Adam could not, but wept,","Though not of woman born; compassion quelled","His best of man, and gave him up to tears","A space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess;","And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed.","O miserable mankind, to what fall","Degraded, to what wretched state reserved!","Better end here unborn.  Why is life given","To be thus wrested from us? rather, why","Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew","What we receive, would either no accept","Life offered, or soon beg to lay it down;","Glad to be so dismissed in peace.  Can thus","The image of God in Man, created once","So goodly and erect, though faulty since,","To such unsightly sufferings be debased","Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,","Retaining still divine similitude","In part, from such deformities be free,","And, for his Maker's image sake, exempt?","Their Maker's image, answered Michael, then","Forsook them, when themselves they vilified","To serve ungoverned Appetite; and took","His image whom they served, a brutish vice,","Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.","Therefore so abject is their punishment,","Disfiguring not God's likeness, but their own;","Or if his likeness, by themselves defaced;","While they pervert pure Nature's healthful rules","To loathsome sickness; worthily, since they","God's image did not reverence in themselves.","I yield it just, said Adam, and submit.","But is there yet no other way, besides","These painful passages, how we may come","To death, and mix with our connatural dust?","There is, said Michael, if thou well observe","The rule of Not too much; by temperance taught,","In what thou eatest and drinkest; seeking from thence","Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,","Till many years over thy head return:","So mayest thou live; till, like ripe fruit, thou drop","Into thy mother's lap; or be with ease","Gathered, nor harshly plucked; for death mature:","This is Old Age; but then, thou must outlive","Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty; which will change","To withered, weak, and gray; thy senses then,","Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forego,","To what thou hast; and, for the air of youth,","Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign","A melancholy damp of cold and dry","To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume","The balm of life.

they tell,","And with vain sceptre strike the hourly bell,","Nor more contribute to the state of things,","Than wooden heads unto the viol's strings.","","While indefatigable Cromwell hies,","And cuts his way still nearer to the skies,","Learning a music in the region clear,","To tune this lower to that higher sphere.","","So when Amphion did the lute command,","Which the god gave him, with his gentle hand,","The rougher stones, unto his measures hewed,","Danced up in order from the quarries rude;","This took a lower, that an higher place,","As he the treble altered, or the bass:","No note he struck, but a new stone was laid,","And the great work ascended while he played.","","The listening structures he with wonder eyed,","And still new stops to various time applied:","Now through the strings a martial rage he throws,","And joining straight the Theban tower arose;","Then as he strokes them with a touch more sweet,","The flocking marbles in a palace meet;","But for the most the graver notes did try,","Therefore the temples reared their columns high:","Thus, ere he ceased, his sacred lute creates","Th' harmonious city of the seven gates.","","Such was that wondrous order and consent,","When Cromwell tuned the ruling Instrument,","While tedious statesmen many years did hack,","Framing a liberty that still went back,","Whose numerous gorge could swallow in an hour","That island, which the sea cannot devour:","Then our Amphion issued out and sings,","And once he struck, and twice, the powerful strings.","","The Commonwealth then first together came,","And each one entered in the willing frame;","All other matter yields, and may be ruled;","But who the minds of stubborn men can build?","No quarry bears a stone so hardly wrought,","Nor with such labour from its centre brought;","None to be sunk in the foundation bends,","Each in the house the highest place contends,","And each the hand that lays him will direct,","And some fall back upon the architect;","Yet all composed by his attractive song,","Into the animated city throng.","","The Commonwealth does through their centres all","Draw the circumference of the public wall;","The crossest spirits here do take their part,","Fastening the contignation which they thwart;","And they, whose nature leads them to divide,","Uphold this one, and that the other side;","But the most equal still sustain the height,","And they as pillars keep the work upright,","While the resistance of opposиd minds,","The fabric (as with arches) stronger binds,","Which on the basis of a senate free,","Knit by the roof's protecting weight, agree.","","When for his foot he thus a place had found,","He hurls e'er since the world about him round,","And in his several aspects, like a star,","Here shines in peace, and thither shoots in war,","While by his beams observing princes steer,","And wisely court the influence they fear.","O would they rather by his pattern won","Kiss the approaching, not yet angry Son;","And in their numbered footsteps humbly tread","The path where holy oracles do lead;","How might they under such a captain raise","The great designs kept for the latter days!","But mad with reason (so miscalled) of state","They know them not, and what they know not, hate.","Hence still they sing hosanna to the whore,","And her, whom they should massacre, adore:","But Indians, whom they would convert, subdue;","Nor teach, but traffic with, or burn the Jew.","","Unhappy princes, ignorantly bred,","By malice some, by error more misled,","If gracious heaven to my life give length,","Leisure to time, and to my weaknes strength,","Then shall I once with graver accents shake","Your regal sloth, and your long slumbers wake:","Like the shrill huntsman that prevents the east,","Winding his horn to kings that chase the beast.","","Till then my muse shall hollo far behind","Angelic Cromwell who outwings the wind,","And in dark nights, and in cold days alone","Pursues the monster through every throne:","Which shrinking to her Roman den impure,","Gnashes her gory teeth; nor there secure.","","Hence oft I think if in some happy hour","High grace should meet in one with highest power,","And then a seasonable people still","Should bend to his, as he to heaven's will,","What we might hope, what wonderful effect","From such a wished conjuncture might reflect.","Sure, the mysterious work, where none withstand,","Would forthwith finish under such a hand:","Foreshortened time its useless course would stay,","And soon precipitate the latest day.","But a thick cloud about that morning lies,","And intercepts the beams of mortal eyes,","That 'tis the most which we determine can,","If these the times, then this must be the man.","And well he therefore does, and well has guessed,","Who in his age has always forward pressed:","And knowing not where heaven's choice may light,","Girds yet his sword, and ready stand to fight;","But men, alas, as if they nothing cared,","Look on, all unconcerned, or unprepared;","And stars still fall, and still the dragon's tail","Swinges the volumes of its horrid flail.","For the great justice that did first suspend","The world by sin, does by the same extend.","Hence that blest day still counterposиd wastes,","The ill delaying what the elected hastes;","Hence landing nature to new seas is tossed,","And good designs still with their authors lost.","","And thou, great Cromwell, for whose happy birth","A mould was chosen out of better earth;","Whose saint-like mother we did lately see","Live out an age, long as a pedigree;","That she might seem (could we the Fall dispute),","T' have smelled the blossom, and not eat the fruit;","Though none does of more lasting parents grow,","Yet never any did them honour so,","Though thou thine heart from evil still unstained,","And always hast thy tongue from fraud refrained;","Thou, who so oft through storms of thundering lead","Hast born securely thine undaunted head,","Thy breast through poniarding conspiracies,","Drawn from the sheath of lying prophecies;","Thee proof behond all other force or skill,","Our sins endanger, and shall one day kill.","","How near they failed, and in thy sudden fall","At once assayed to overturn us all.","Our brutish fury struggling to be free,","Hurried thy horses while they hurried thee,","When thou hadst almost quit thy mortal cares,","And soiled in dust thy crown of silver hairs.","","Let this one sorrow interweave among","The other glories of our yearly song.","Like skilful looms, which through the costly thread","Of purling ore, a shining wave do shed:","So shall the tears we on past grief employ,","Still as they trickle, glitter in our joy.","So with more modesty we may be true,","And speak, as of the dead, the praises due:","While impious men deceived with pleasure short,","On their own hopes shall find the fall retort.","","But the poor beasts, wanting their noble guide,","(What could they more?) shrunk guiltily aside.","First wingиd fear transports them far away,","And leaden sorrow then their flight did stay.","See how they each his towering crest abate,","And the green grass, and their known mangers hate,","Nor through wide nostrils snuff the wanton air,","Nor their round hoofs, or curlиd manes compare;","With wandering eyes, and restless ears they stood,","And with shrill neighings asked him of the wood.","","Thou, Cromwell, falling, not a stupid tree,","Or rock so savage, but it mourned for thee:","And all about was heard a panic groan,","As if that Nature's self were overthrown.","It seemed the earth did from the centre tear;","It seemed the sun was fall'n out of the sphere:","Justice obstructed lay, and reason fooled;","Courage disheartened, and religion cooled.","A dismal silence through the palace went,","And then loud shrieks the vaulted marbles rent,","Such as the dying chorus sings by turns,","And to deaf seas, and ruthless tempests mourns,","When now they sink, and now the plundering streams","Break up each deck, and rip the oaken seams.","","But thee triumphant hence the fiery car,","And fiery steeds had borne out of the war,","From the low world, and thankless men above,","Unto the kingdom blest of peace and love:","We only mourned ourselves, in thine ascent,","Whom thou hadst left beneath with mantle rent.","","For all delight of life thou then didst lose,","When to command, thou didst thyself dispose;","Resigning up thy privacy so dear,","To turn the headstrong people's charioteer;","For to be Cromwell was a greater thing,","Then ought below, or yet above a king:","Therefore thou rather didst thyself depress,","Yielding to rule, because it made thee less.","","For neither didst thou from the first apply","Thy sober spirit unto things too high,","But in thine own fields exercised'st long,","An healthful mind within a body strong;","Till at the seventh time thou in the skies,","As a small cloud, like a man's hand, didst rise;","Then did thick mists and winds the air deform,","And down at last thou poured'st the fertile storm,","Which to the thirsty land did plenty bring,","But, though forewarned, o'ertook and wet the King.","","What since he did, an higher force him pushed","Still from behind, and yet before him rushed,","Though undiscerned among the tumult blind,","Who think those high decrees by man designed.","'Twas heaven would not that his power should cease,","But walk still middle betwixt war and peace:","Choosing each stone, and poising every weight,","Trying the measures of the breadth and height;","Here pulling down, and there erecting new,","Founding a firm state by proportions true.","","When Gideon so did from the war retreat,","Yet by the conquest of two kings grown great,","He on the peace extends a warlike power,","And Israel silent saw him raze the tower;","And how he Succorth's Elders durst suppress,","With thorns and briars of the wilderness.","No king might ever such a force have done;","Yet would not he be Lord, nor yet his son.","","Thou with the same strength, and an heart as plain,","Didst (like thine olive) still refuse to reign,","Though why should others all thy labour spoil,","And brambles be anointed with thine oil,","Whose climbing flame, without a timely stop,","Had quickly levelled every cedar's top?","Therefore first growing to thyself a law,","Th' ambitious shrubs thou in just time didst awe.","","So have I seen at sea, when whirling winds,","Hurry the bark, but more the seamen's minds,","Who with mistaken course salute the sand,","And threatening rocks misapprehend for land,","While baleful Tritons to the shipwreck guide,","And corposants along the tackling slide,","The passengers all wearied out before,","Giddy, and wishing for the fatal shore,","Some lusty mate, who with more careful eye","Counted the hours, and every star did spy,","The help does from the artless steersman strain,","And doubles back unto the safer main.","What though a while they grumble discontent,","Saving himself, he does their loss prevent.","","'Tis not a freedom, that where all command;","Nor tyranny, where one does them withstand:","But who of both the bounder knows to lay","Him as their father must the state obey.","","Thou, and thine house (like Noah's eight) did rest,","Left by the wars' flood on the mountains' crest:","And the large vale lay subject to thy will","Which thou but as an husbandman wouldst till:","And only didst for others plant the vine","Of liberty, not drunken with its wine.","","That sober liberty which men may have,","That they enjoy, but more they vainly crave:","And such as to their parents' tents do press,","May show their own, not see his nakedness.","","Yet such a Chammish issue still does rage,","The shame and plague both of the land and age,","Who watched thy halting, and thy fall deride,","Rejoicing when thy foot had slipped aside,","That their new king might the fifth sceptre shake,","And make the world, by his example, quake:","Whose frantic army should they want for men","Might muster heresies, so one were ten.","What thy misfortune, they the spirit call,","And their religion only is to fall.","Oh Mahomet! now couldst thou rise again,","Thy falling-sickness should have made thee reign,","While Feake and Simpson would in many a tome,","Have writ the comments of thy sacred foam:","For soon thou mightst have passed among their rant","Were't but for thine unmovиd tulipant;","As thou must needs have owned them of thy band","For prophecies fit to be Alcoraned.","","Accursиd locusts, whom your king does spit","Out of the centre of the unbottomed pit;","Wanderers, adulterers, liars, Munster's rest,","Sorcerers, athiests, jesuits possessed;","You who the scriptures and the laws deface","With the same liberty as points and lace;","Oh race most hypocritically strict!","Bent to reduce us to the ancient Pict;","Well may you act the Adam and the Eve;","Ay, and the serpent too that did deceive.","","But the great captain, now the danger's o'er,","Makes you for his sake tremble one fit more;","And, to your spite, returning yet alive","Does with himself all that is good revive.","","So when first man did through the morning new","See the bright sun his shining race pursue,","All day he followed with unwearied sight,","Pleased with that other world of moving light;","But thought him when he missed his setting beams,","Sunk in the hills, or plunged below the streams.","While dismal blacks hung round the universe,","And stars (like tapers) burned upon his hearse:","And owls and ravens with their screeching noise","Did make the funerals sadder by their joys.","His weeping eyes the doleful vigils keep,","Not knowing yet the night was made for sleep;","Still to the west, where he him lost, he turned,","And with such accents as despairing mourned:","`Why did mine eyes once see so bright a ray;","Or why day last no longer than a day?'","When straight the sun behind him he descried,","Smiling serenely from the further side.","","So while our star that gives us light and heat,","Seemed now a long and gloomy night to threat,","Up from the other world his flame he darts,","And princes (shining through their windows) starts,","Who their suspected counsellors refuse,","And credulous ambassadors accuse.","","`Is this', saith one, `the nation that we read","Spent with both wars, under a captain dead,","Yet rig a navy while we dress us late,","And ere we dine, raze and rebuild their state?","What oaken forests, and what golden mines!","What mints of men, what union of designs!","(Unless their ships, do, as their fowl proceed","Of shedding leaves, that with their ocean breed).","Theirs are not ships, but rather arks of war","And beakиd promontories sailed from far;","Of floating islands a new hatchиd nest;","A fleet of worlds, of other worlds in quest;","An hideous shoal of wood-leviathans,","Armed with three tier of brazen hurricanes,","That through the centre shoot their thundering side","And sink the earth that does at anchor ride.","What refuge to escape them can be found,","Whose watery leaguers all the world surround?","Needs must we all their tributaries be,","Whose navies hold the sluices of the sea.","The ocean is the fountain of command,","But that once took, we captives are on land.","And those that have the waters for their share,","Can quickly leave us neither earth nor air.","Yet if through these our fears could find a pass,","Through double oak, and lined with treble brass,","That one man still, although but named, alarms","More than all men, all navies, and all arms.","Him, in the day, him, in late night I dread,","And still his sword seems hanging o'er my head.","The nation had been ours, but his one soul","Moves the great bulk, and animates the whole.","He secrecy with number hath enchased,","Courage with age, maturity with haste:","The valiant's terror, riddle of the wise,","And still his falchion all our knots unties.","Where did he learn those arts that cost us dear?","Where below earth, or where above the sphere?","He seems a king by long succession born,","And yet the same to be a king does scorn.","Abroad a king he seems, and something more,","At home a subject on the equal floor.","O could I once him with our title see,","So should I hope that he might die as we.","But let them write is praise that love him best,","It grieves me sore to have thus much confessed.'","","Pardon, great Prince, if thus their fear of spite","More than our love and duty do thee right.","I yield, nor further will the prize contend,","So that we both alike may miss our end:","While thou thy venerable head dost raise","As far above their malice as my praise,","And as the Angel of our commonweal,","Troubling the waters, yearly mak'st them heal."],"linecount":"402"},{"title":"115.

Who, therefore, seeks in these","True wisdom finds her not, or, by delusion","Far worse, her false resemblance only meets,","An empty cloud.  However, many books,","Wise men have said, are wearisome; who reads","Incessantly, and to his reading brings not","A spirit and judgment equal or superior,","(And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek?)","Uncertain and unsettled still remains,","Deep-versed in books and shallow in himself,","Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys","And trifles for choice matters, worth a sponge,","As children gathering pebbles on the shore.","Or, if I would delight my private hours","With music or with poem, where so soon","As in our native language can I find","That solace?

The Wilderness","For thee is fittest place: I found thee there,","And thither will return thee.  Yet remember","What I foretell thee; soon thou shalt have cause","To wish thou never hadst rejected, thus","Nicely or cautiously, my offered aid,","Which would have set thee in short time with ease","On David's throne, or throne of all the world,","Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season,","When prophecies of thee are best fulfilled.","Now, contrary—if I read aught in heaven,","Or heaven write aught of fate—by what the stars","Voluminous, or single characters","In their conjunction met, give me to spell,","Sorrows and labours, opposition, hate,","Attends thee; scorns, reproaches, injuries,","Violence and stripes, and, lastly, cruel death.","A kingdom they portend thee, but what kingdom,","Real or allegoric, I discern not;","Nor when: eternal sure—as without end,","Without beginning; for no date prefixed","Directs me in the starry rubric set.\"","  So saying, he took (for still he knew his power","Not yet expired), and to the Wilderness","Brought back, the Son of God, and left him there,","Feigning to disappear.  Darkness now rose,","As daylight sunk, and brought in louring Night,","Her shadowy offspring, unsubstantial both,","Privation mere of light and absent day.","Our Saviour, meek, and with untroubled mind","After hisaerie jaunt, though hurried sore,","Hungry and cold, betook him to his rest,","Wherever, under some concourse of shades,","Whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield","From dews and damps of night his sheltered head;","But, sheltered, slept in vain; for at his head","The Tempter watched, and soon with ugly dreams","Disturbed his sleep.  And either tropic now","'Gan thunder, and both ends of heaven; the clouds","From many a horrid rift abortive poured","Fierce rain with lightning mixed, water with fire,","In ruin reconciled; nor slept the winds","Within their stony caves, but rushed abroad","From the four hinges of the world, and fell","On the vexed wilderness, whose tallest pines,","Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest oaks,","Bowed their stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts,","Or torn up sheer.  Ill wast thou shrouded then,","O patient Son of God, yet only stood'st","Unshaken!  Nor yet staid the terror there:","Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round","Environed thee; some howled, some yelled, some shrieked,","Some bent at thee their fiery darts, while thou","Sat'st unappalled in calm and sinless peace.","Thus passed the night so foul, till Morning fair","Came forth with pilgrim steps, in amice grey,","Who with her radiant finger stilled the roar","Of thunder, chased the clouds, and laid the winds,","And griesly spectres, which the Fiend had raised","To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire.","And now the sun with more effectual beams","Had cheered the face of earth, and dried the wet","From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds,","Who all things now behold more fresh and green,","After a night of storm so ruinous,","Cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray,","To gratulate the sweet return of morn.","Nor yet, amidst this joy and brightest morn,","Was absent, after all his mischief done,","The Prince of Darkness; glad would also seem","Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came;","Yet with no new device (they all were spent),","Rather by this his last affront resolved,","Desperate of better course, to vent his rage","And mad despite to be so oft repelled.","Him walking on a sunny hill he found,","Backed on the north and west by a thick wood;","Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape,","And in a careless mood thus to him said:—","  \"Fair morning yet betides thee, Son of God,","After a dismal night.  I heard the wrack,","As earth and sky would mingle; but myself","Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them,","As dangerous to the pillared frame of Heaven,","Or to the Earth's dark basis underneath,","Are to the main as inconsiderable","And harmless, if not wholesome, as a sneeze","To man's less universe, and soon are gone.","Yet, as being ofttimes noxious where they light","On man, beast, plant, wasteful and turbulent,","Like turbulencies in the affairs of men,","Over whose heads they roar, and seem to point,","They oft fore-signify and threaten ill.","This tempest at this desert most was bent;","Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st.","Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject","The perfect season offered with my aid","To win thy destined seat, but wilt prolong","All to the push of fate, pursue thy way","Of gaining David's throne no man knows when","(For both the when and how is nowhere told),","Thou shalt be what thou art ordained, no doubt;","For Angels have proclaimed it, but concealing","The time and means?  Each act is rightliest done","Not when it must, but when it may be best.","If thou observe not this, be sure to find","What I foretold thee—many a hard assay","Of dangers, and adversities, and pains,","Ere thou of Israel's sceptre get fast hold;","Whereof this ominous night that closed thee round,","So many terrors, voices, prodigies,","May warn thee, as a sure foregoing sign.\"","  So talked he, while the Son of God went on,","And staid not, but in brief him answered thus:—","  \"Me worse than wet thou find'st not; other harm","Those terrors which thou speak'st of did me none.","I never feared they could, though noising loud","And threatening nigh: what they can do as signs","Betokening or ill-boding I contemn","As false portents, not sent from God, but thee;","Who, knowing I shall reign past thy preventing,","Obtrud'st thy offered aid, that I, accepting,","At least might seem to hold all power of thee,","Ambitious Spirit! and would'st be thought my God;","And storm'st, refused, thinking to terrify","Me to thy will!  Desist (thou art discerned,","And toil'st in vain), nor me in vain molest.\"","  To whom the Fiend, now swoln with rage, replied:—","\"Then hear, O Son of David, virgin-born!","For Son of God to me is yet in doubt.","Of the Messiah I have heard foretold","By all the Prophets; of thy birth, at length","Announced by Gabriel, with the first I knew,","And of the angelic song in Bethlehem field,","On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born.","From that time seldom have I ceased to eye","Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth,","Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred;","Till, at the ford of Jordan, whither all","Flocked to the Baptist, I among the rest","(Though not to be baptized), by voice from Heaven","Heard thee pronounced the Son of God beloved.","Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view","And narrower scrutiny, that I might learn","In what degree or meaning thou art called","The Son of God, which bears no single sense.","The Son of God I also am, or was;","And, if I was, I am; relation stands:","All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought","In some respect far higher so declared.","Therefore I watched thy footsteps from that hour,","And followed thee still on to this waste wild,","Where, by all best conjectures, I collect","Thou art to be my fatal enemy.","Good reason, then, if I beforehand seek","To understand my adversary, who","And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent;","By parle or composition, truce or league,","To win him, or win from him what I can.","And opportunity I here have had","To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee","Proof against all temptation, as a rock","Of adamant and as a centre, firm","To the utmost of mere man both wise and good,","Not more; for honours, riches, kingdoms, glory,","Have been before contemned, and may again.","Therefore, to know what more thou art than man,","Worth naming the Son of God by voice from Heaven,","Another method I must now begin.\"","  So saying, he caught him up, and, without wing","Of hippogrif, bore through the air sublime,","Over the wilderness and o'er the plain,","Till underneath them fair Jerusalem,","The Holy City, lifted high her towers,","And higher yet the glorious Temple reared","Her pile, far off appearing like a mount","Of alablaster, topt with golden spires:","There, on the highest pinnacle, he set","The Son of God, and added thus in scorn:—","  \"There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright","Will ask thee skill.  I to thy Father's house","Have brought thee, and highest placed: highest is best.","Now shew thy progeny; if not to stand,","Cast thyself down.  Safely, if Son of God;","For it is written, 'He will give command","Concerning thee to his Angels; in their hands","They shall uplift thee, lest at any time","Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.'\"","  To whom thus Jesus: \"Also it is written,","'Tempt not the Lord thy God.'\"  He said, and stood;","But Satan, smitten with amazement, fell.","As when Earth's son, Antaeus (to compare","Small things with greatest), in Irassa strove","With Jove's Alcides, and, oft foiled, still rose,","Receiving from his mother Earth new strength,","Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joined,","Throttled at length in the air expired and fell,","So, after many a foil, the Tempter proud,","Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride","Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall;","And, as that Theban monster that proposed","Her riddle, and him who solved it not devoured,","That once found out and solved, for grief and spite","Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep,","So, strook with dread and anguish, fell the Fiend,","And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought","Joyless triumphals of his hoped success,","Ruin, and desperation, and dismay,","Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God.","So Satan fell; and straight a fiery globe","Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh,","Who on their plumy vans received Him soft","From his uneasy station, and upbore,","As on a floating couch, through the blithe air;","Then, in a flowery valley, set him down","On a green bank, and set before him spread","A table of celestial food, divine","Ambrosial fruits fetched from the Tree of Life,","And from the Fount of Life ambrosial drink,","That soon refreshed him wearied, and repaired","What hunger, if aught hunger, had impaired,","Or thirst; and, as he fed, Angelic quires","Sung heavenly anthems of his victory","Over temptation and the Tempter proud:—","  \"True Image of the Father, whether throned","In the bosom of bliss, and light of light","Conceiving, or, remote from Heaven, enshrined","In fleshly tabernacle and human form,","Wandering the wilderness—whatever place,","Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing","The Son of God, with Godlike force endued","Against the attempter of thy Father's throne","And thief of Paradise!  Him long of old","Thou didst debel, and down from Heaven cast","With all his army; now thou hast avenged","Supplanted Adam, and, by vanquishing","Temptation, hast regained lost Paradise,","And frustrated the conquest fraudulent.","He never more henceforth will dare set foot","In paradise to tempt; his snares are broke.","For, though that seat of earthly bliss be failed,","A fairer Paradise is founded now","For Adam and his chosen sons, whom thou,","A Saviour, art come down to reinstall;","Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be,","Of tempter and temptation without fear.","But thou, Infernal Serpent! shalt not long","Rule in the clouds.  Like an autumnal star,","Or lightning, thou shalt fall from Heaven, trod down","Under his feet.  For proof, ere this thou feel'st","Thy wound (yet not thy last and deadliest wound)","By this repulse received, and hold'st in Hell","No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues","Thy bold attempt.  Hereafter learn with awe","To dread the Son of God.  He, all unarmed,","Shall chase thee, with the terror of his voice,","From thy demoniac holds, possession foul—","Thee and thy legions; yelling they shall fly,","And beg to hide them in a herd of swine,","Lest he command them down into the Deep,","Bound, and to torment sent before their time.","Hail, Son of the Most High, heir of both Worlds,","Queller of Satan!  On thy glorious work","Now enter, and begin to save Mankind.\"","  Thus they the Son of God, our Saviour meek,","Sung victor, and, from heavenly feast refreshed,","Brought on his way with joy.

Behold! he walks","On heaven's pavement; brotherly he talks","To divine powers: from his hand full fain","Juno's proud birds are pecking pearly grain:","He tries the nerve of Phoebus' golden bow,","And asketh where the golden apples grow:","Upon his arm he braces Pallas' shield,","And strives in vain to unsettle and wield","A Jovian thunderbolt: arch Hebe brings","A full-brimm'd goblet, dances lightly, sings","And tantalizes long; at last he drinks,","And lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,","Touching with dazzled lips her starlight hand.","He blows a bugle,--an ethereal band","Are visible above: the Seasons four,--","Green-kyrtled Spring, flush Summer, golden store","In Autumn's sickle, Winter frosty hoar,","Join dance with shadowy Hours; while still the blast,","In swells unmitigated, still doth last","To sway their floating morris. \"Whose is this?","Whose bugle?\" he inquires: they smile--\"O Dis!","Why is this mortal here?

Then doth he spring","Towards her, and awakes--and, strange, o'erhead,","Of those same fragrant exhalations bred,","Beheld awake his very dream: the gods","Stood smiling; merry Hebe laughs and nods;","And Phoebe bends towards him crescented.","O state perplexing! On the pinion bed,","Too well awake, he feels the panting side","Of his delicious lady. He who died","For soaring too audacious in the sun,","Where that same treacherous wax began to run,","Felt not more tongue-tied than Endymion.","His heart leapt up as to its rightful throne,","To that fair shadow'd passion puls'd its way--","Ah, what perplexity!

Straight he seiz'd her wrist;","It melted from his grasp: her hand he kiss'd,","And, horror! kiss'd his own--he was alone.","Her steed a little higher soar'd, and then","Dropt hawkwise to the earth.        There lies a den,","Beyond the seeming confines of the space","Made for the soul to wander in and trace","Its own existence, of remotest glooms.","Dark regions are around it, where the tombs","Of buried griefs the spirit sees, but scarce","One hour doth linger weeping, for the pierce","Of new-born woe it feels more inly smart:","And in these regions many a venom'd dart","At random flies; they are the proper home","Of every ill: the man is yet to come","Who hath not journeyed in this native hell.","But few have ever felt how calm and well","Sleep may be had in that deep den of all.","There anguish does not sting; nor pleasure pall:","Woe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,","Yet all is still within and desolate.","Beset with painful gusts, within ye hear","No sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier","The death-watch tick is stifled. Enter none","Who strive therefore: on the sudden it is won.","Just when the sufferer begins to burn,","Then it is free to him; and from an urn,","Still fed by melting ice, he takes a draught--","Young Semele such richness never quaft","In her maternal longing. Happy gloom!","Dark Paradise! where pale becomes the bloom","Of health by due; where silence dreariest","Is most articulate; where hopes infest;","Where those eyes are the brightest far that keep","Their lids shut longest in a dreamless sleep.","O happy spirit-home! O wondrous soul!","Pregnant with such a den to save the whole","In thine own depth. Hail, gentle Carian!","For, never since thy griefs and woes began,","Hast thou felt so content: a grievous feud","Hath let thee to this Cave of Quietude.","Aye, his lull'd soul was there, although upborne","With dangerous speed: and so he did not mourn","Because he knew not whither he was going.","So happy was he, not the aerial blowing","Of trumpets at clear parley from the east","Could rouse from that fine relish, that high feast.","They stung the feather'd horse: with fierce alarm","He flapp'd towards the sound. Alas, no charm","Could lift Endymion's head, or he had view'd","A skyey mask, a pinion'd multitude,--","And silvery was its passing: voices sweet","Warbling the while as if to lull and greet","The wanderer in his path.

He was","Indeed all you have said. I better bore","The deaths of the two sons Heaven took from me,","Than Jacopo's disgrace.","","_Mar._                 That word again?","","_Doge_. Has he not been condemned?","","_Mar._                            Is none but guilt so?","","_Doge_. Time may restore his memory--I would hope so.","He was my pride, my----but 'tis useless now--","I am not given to tears, but wept for joy","When he was born: those drops were ominous.","","_Mar._ I say he's innocent! And were he not so,","Is our own blood and kin to shrink from us","In fatal moments?","","_Doge_.

We?","","_Lor._                       \"The Ten\" in council.","","_Doge_.

And did not they?","","_Lor._                   The Grave knows best: they died,","As I said, suddenly.","","_Doge_.             Is that so strange,","That you repeat the word emphatically?","","_Lor._ So far from strange, that never was there death","In my mind half so natural as theirs.","Think _you_ not so?","","_Doge_.

I understand you;","Your sires were mine, and you are heir in all things.","","_Lor._ You best know if I should be so.","","_Doge_.                                  I do.","Your fathers were my foes, and I have heard","Foul rumours were abroad; I have also read","Their epitaph, attributing their deaths","To poison.

I!----'Tis true","Your fathers were mine enemies, as bitter","As their son e'er can be, and I no less","Was theirs; but I was _openly_ their foe:","I never worked by plot in Council, nor","Cabal in commonwealth, nor secret means","Of practice against life by steel or drug.","The proof is--your existence.","","_Lor._                       I fear not.","","_Doge_. You have no cause, being what I am; but were I","That you would have me thought, you long ere now","Were past the sense of fear.

But I, good Signor,","Am, or at least _was_, more than a mere duke,","In blood, in mind, in means; and that they know","Who dreaded to elect me, and have since","Striven all they dare to weigh me down: be sure,","Before or since that period, had I held you","At so much price as to require your absence,","A word of mine had set such spirits to work","As would have made you nothing.

All things are so to mortals; who can read them","Save he who made? or, if they can, the few","And gifted spirits, who have studied long","That loathsome volume--man, and pored upon","Those black and bloody leaves, his heart and brain,","But learn a magic which recoils upon","The adept who pursues it: all the sins","We find in others, Nature made our own;","All our advantages are those of Fortune;","Birth, wealth, health, beauty, are her accidents,","And when we cry out against Fate, 'twere well","We should remember Fortune can take nought","Save what she _gave_--the rest was nakedness,","And lusts, and appetites, and vanities,","The universal heritage, to battle","With as we may, and least in humblest stations,","Where Hunger swallows all in one low want,","And the original ordinance, that man","Must sweat for his poor pittance, keeps all passions","Aloof, save fear of famine! All is low,","And false, and hollow--clay from first to last,","The Prince's urn no less than potter's vessel.","Our Fame is in men's breath, our lives upon","Less than their breath; our durance upon days","Our days on seasons; our whole being on","Something which is not _us_!--So, we are slaves,","The greatest as the meanest--nothing rests","Upon our will; the will itself no less","Depends upon a straw than on a storm;","And when we think we lead, we are most led,","And still towards Death, a thing which comes as much","Without our act or choice as birth, so that","Methinks we must have sinned in some old world,","And _this_ is Hell: the best is, that it is not","Eternal.","","_Mar._ These are things we cannot judge","On earth.","","_Doge_. And how then shall we judge each other,","Who are all earth, and I, who am called upon","To judge my son? I have administered","My country faithfully--victoriously--","I dare them to the proof, the _chart_ of what","She was and is: my reign has doubled realms;","And, in reward, the gratitude of Venice","Has left, or is about to leave, _me_ single.","","_Mar._ And Foscari? I do not think of such things,","So I be left with him.","","_Doge_.               You shall be so;","Thus much they cannot well deny.","","_Mar._                          And if","They should, I will fly with him.","","_Doge_.

What, wouldst thou have a renegade for husband,","And turn him into traitor?","","_Mar._                    He is none!","The Country is the traitress, which thrusts forth","Her best and bravest from her. Tyranny","Is far the worst of treasons. Dost thou deem","None rebels except subjects? The Prince who","Neglects or violates his trust is more","A brigand than the robber-chief.","","_Doge_.                          I cannot","Charge me with such a breach of faith.","","_Mar_                                 No; thou","Observ'st, obey'st such laws as make old Draco's","A code of mercy by comparison.","","_Doge_. I found the law; I did not make it. Were I","A subject, still I might find parts and portions","Fit for amendment; but as Prince, I never","Would change, for the sake of my house, the charter","Left by our fathers.","","_Mar._              Did they make it for","The ruin of their children?","","_Doge_.                    Under such laws, Venice","Has risen to what she is--a state to rival","In deeds, and days, and sway, and, let me add,","In glory (for we have had Roman spirits","Amongst us), all that history has bequeathed","Of Rome and Carthage in their best times, when","The people swayed by Senates.","","_Mar._                       Rather say,","Groaned under the stern Oligarchs.","","_Doge_.                           Perhaps so;","But yet subdued the World: in such a state","An individual, be he richest of","Such rank as is permitted, or the meanest,","Without a name, is alike nothing, when","The policy, irrevocably tending","To one great end, must be maintained in vigour.","","_Mar._ This means that you are more a Doge than father.","","_Doge_. It means, I am more citizen than either.","If we had not for many centuries","Had thousands of such citizens, and shall,","I trust, have still such, Venice were no city.","","_Mar._ Accurséd be the city where the laws","Would stifle Nature's!","","_Doge_.               Had I as many sons","As I have years, I would have given them all,","Not without feeling, but I would have given them","To the State's service, to fulfil her wishes,","On the flood, in the field, or, if it must be,","As it, alas! has been, to ostracism,","Exile, or chains, or whatsoever worse","She might decree.","","_Mar._           And this is Patriotism?","To me it seems the worst barbarity.","Let me seek out my husband: the sage \"Ten,\"","With all its jealousy, will hardly war","So far with a weak woman as deny me","A moment's access to his dungeon.","","_Doge_.                          I'll","So far take on myself, as order that","You may be admitted.","","_Mar._              And what shall I say","To Foscari from his father?","","_Doge_.                    That he obey","The laws.","","_Mar._   And nothing more? Will you not see him","Ere he depart? It may be the last time.","","_Doge_. The last!--my boy!--the last time I shall see","My last of children! Tell him I will come.                  [_Exeunt_.","","ACT III.","","SCENE I.--_The prison of_ JACOPO FOSCARI.","","_Jac. Fos._ (_solus_).","No light, save yon faint gleam which shows me walls","Which never echoed but to Sorrow's sounds,","The sigh of long imprisonment, the step","Of feet on which the iron clanked the groan","Of Death, the imprecation of Despair!","And yet for this I have returned to Venice,","With some faint hope, 'tis true, that Time, which wears","The marble down, had worn away the hate","Of men's hearts; but I knew them not, and here","Must I consume my own, which never beat","For Venice but with such a yearning as","The dove has for her distant nest, when wheeling","High in the air on her return to greet","Her callow brood.

Fos._ These walls are silent of men's ends; they only","Seem to hint shrewdly of them. Such stern walls","Were never piled on high save o'er the dead,","Or those who soon must be so.--_What of him?_","Thou askest.--What of me? may soon be asked,","With the like answer--doubt and dreadful surmise--","Unless thou tell'st my tale.","","_Mar._                     _I speak_ of thee!","","_Jac.

Fos._              Aye--we but hear","Of the survivors' toil in their new lands,","Their numbers and success; but who can number","The hearts which broke in silence at that parting,","Or after their departure; of that malady","Which calls up green and native fields to view","From the rough deep, with such identity","To the poor exile's fevered eye, that he","Can scarcely be restrained from treading them?","That melody, which out of tones and tunes","Collects such pasture for the longing sorrow","Of the sad mountaineer, when far away","From his snow canopy of cliffs and clouds,","That he feeds on the sweet, but poisonous thought,","And dies. You call this _weakness_! It is strength,","I say,--the parent of all honest feeling.","He who loves not his Country, can love nothing.","","_Mar._ Obey her, then: 'tis she that puts thee forth.","","_Jac. Fos._ Aye, there it is; 'tis like a mother's curse","Upon my soul--the mark is set upon me.","The exiles you speak of went forth by nations,","Their hands upheld each other by the way,","Their tents were pitched together--I'm alone.","","_Mar._ You shall be so no more--I will go with thee.","","_Jac. Fos._ My best Marina!--and our children?","","_Mar._                                        They,","I fear, by the prevention of the state's","Abhorrent policy, (which holds all ties","As threads, which may be broken at her pleasure),","Will not be suffered to proceed with us.","","_Jac.

From this","Learn you to sway your feelings, when exacted","By duties paramount; and 'tis our first","On earth to bear.","","_Jac. Fos._      Have I not borne?","","_Mar._                            Too much","From tyrannous injustice, and enough","To teach you not to shrink now from a lot,","Which, as compared with what you have undergone","Of late, is mercy.","","_Jac. Fos._       Ah! you never yet","Were far away from Venice, never saw","Her beautiful towers in the receding distance,","While every furrow of the vessel's track","Seemed ploughing deep into your heart; you never","Saw day go down upon your native spires","So calmly with its gold and crimson glory,","And after dreaming a disturbéd vision","Of them and theirs, awoke and found them not.","","_Mar._ I will divide this with you. Let us think","Of our departure from this much-loved city,","(Since you must _love_ it, as it seems,) and this","Chamber of state, her gratitude allots you.","Our children will be cared for by the Doge,","And by my uncles; we must sail ere night.","","_Jac. Fos._ That's sudden. Shall I not behold my father?","","_Mar._ You will.","","_Jac. Fos._     Where?","","_Mar._                Here, or in the ducal chamber--","He said not which. I would that you could bear","Your exile as he bears it.","","_Jac. Fos._               Blame him not.","I sometimes murmur for a moment; but","He could not now act otherwise. A show","Of feeling or compassion on his part","Would have but drawn upon his agéd head","Suspicion from \"the Ten,\" and upon mine","Accumulated ills.","","_Mar._           Accumulated!","What pangs are those they have spared you?","","_Jac. Fos._                               That of leaving","Venice without beholding him or you,","Which might have been forbidden now, as 'twas","Upon my former exile.","","_Mar._               That is true,","And thus far I am also the State's debtor,","And shall be more so when I see us both","Floating on the free waves--away--away--","Be it to the earth's end, from this abhorred,","Unjust, and----","","_Jac.

How can you know that till you hear him?","","_Ink_.                                          I heard","Quite enough; and, to tell you the truth, my retreat","Was from his vile nonsense, no less than the heat.","","_Tra_. I have had no great loss then?","","_Ink_.                                Loss!--such a palaver!","I'd inoculate sooner my wife with the slaver","Of a dog when gone rabid, than listen two hours","To the torrent of trash which around him he pours,","Pumped up with such effort, disgorged with such labour,","That----come--do not make me speak ill of one's neighbour.","","_Tra_. _I_ make you!","","_Ink_.                   Yes, you! I said nothing until","You compelled me, by speaking the truth----","","_Tra_.                               _To speak ill?_","Is that your deduction?","","_Ink_.                 When speaking of Scamp ill,","I certainly _follow, not set_ an example.","The fellow's a fool, an impostor, a zany.","","_Tra_. And the crowd of to-day shows that one fool makes many.","But we two will be wise.","","_Ink_.                  Pray, then, let us retire.","","_Tra_. I would, but----","","_Ink_.                There must be attraction much higher","Than Scamp, or the Jew's harp he nicknames his lyre,","To call you to this hotbed.","","_Tra_.                     I own it--'tis true--","A fair lady----","","_Ink_.       A spinster?","","_Tra_.                  Miss Lilac.","","_Ink_.                               The Blue!","","_Tra_. The heiress! The angel!","","_Ink_.                         The devil! why, man,","Pray get out of this hobble as fast as you can.","_You_ wed with Miss Lilac! 'twould be your perdition:","She's a poet, a chymist, a mathematician.","","_Tra_. I say she's an angel.","","_Ink_.                      Say rather an angle.","If you and she marry, you'll certainly wrangle.","I say she's a Blue, man, as blue as the ether.","","_Tra_. And is that any cause for not coming together?","","_Ink_. Humph! I can't say I know any happy alliance","Which has lately sprung up from a wedlock with science.","She's so learnéd in all things, and fond of concerning","Herself in all matters connected with learning,","That----","","_Tra_.  What?","","_Ink_.        I perhaps may as well hold my tongue;","But there's five hundred people can tell you you're","wrong.","","_Tra_. You forget Lady Lilac's as rich as a Jew.","","_Ink_. Is it miss or the cash of mamma you pursue?","","_Tra_. Why, Jack, I'll be frank with you--something of both.","The girl's a fine girl.","","_Ink_.                 And you feel nothing loth","To her good lady-mother's reversion; and yet","Her life is as good as your own, I will bet.","","_Tra_. Let her live, and as long as she likes; I demand","Nothing more than the heart of her daughter and hand.","","_Ink_. Why, that heart's in the inkstand--that hand on the pen.","","_Tra_. A propos--Will you write me a song now and then?","","_Ink_. To what purpose?","","_Tra_.                 You know, my dear friend, that in prose","My talent is decent, as far as it goes;","But in rhyme----","","_Ink_.         You're a terrible stick, to be sure.","","_Tra_. I own it; and yet, in these times, there's no lure","For the heart of the fair like a stanza or two;","And so, as I can't, will you furnish a few?","","_Ink_. In your name?","","_Tra_.               In my name. I will copy them out,","To slip into her hand at the very next rout.","","_Ink_. Are you so far advanced as to hazard this?","","_Tra_.                                            Why,","Do you think me subdued by a Blue-stocking's eye,","So far as to tremble to tell her in rhyme","What I've told her in prose, at the least, as sublime?","","_Ink_. _As sublime!_ If i be so, no need of my Muse.","","_Tra_. But consider, dear Inkel, she's one of the \"Blues.\"","","_Ink_. As sublime!--Mr. Tracy--I've nothing to say.","Stick to prose--As sublime!!--but I wish you good day.","","_Tra_. Nay, stay, my dear fellow--consider--I'm wrong;","I own it; but, prithee, compose me the song.","","_Ink_. _As_ sublime!!","","_Tra_.                 I but used the expression in haste.","","_Ink_. That may be, Mr. Tracy, but shows damned bad taste.","","_Tra_. I own it, I know it, acknowledge it--what","Can I say to you more?","","_Ink_.                 I see what you'd be at:","You disparage my parts with insidious abuse,","Till you think you can turn them best to your own use.","","_Tra_. And is that not a sign I respect them?","","_Ink_.                                        Why that","To be sure makes a difference.","","_Tra_.                        I know what is what:","And you, who're a man of the gay world, no less","Than a poet of t'other, may easily guess","That I never could mean, by a word, to offend","A genius like you, and, moreover, my friend.","","_Ink_. No doubt; you by this time should know what is due","To a man of----but come--let us shake hands.","","_Tra_.                                      You knew,","And you _know_, my dear fellow, how heartily I,","Whatever you publish, am ready to buy.","","_Ink_. That's my bookseller's business; I care not for sale;","Indeed the best poems at first rather fail.","There were Renegade's epics, and Botherby's plays,","And my own grand romance--","","_Tra_.                     Had its full share of praise.","I myself saw it puffed in the \"Old Girl's Review.\"","","_Ink_. What Review?","","_Tra_.              Tis the English \"Journal de Trevoux;\"","A clerical work of our Jesuits at home.","Have you never yet seen it?","","_Ink_.                     That pleasure's to come.","","_Tra_. Make haste then.","","_Ink_.                  Why so?","","_Tra_.                         I have heard people say","That it threatened to give up the _ghost_ t'other day.","","_Ink_. Well, that is a sign of some _spirit_.","","_Tra_.                                            No doubt.","Shall you be at the Countess of Fiddlecome's rout?","","_Ink_. I've a card, and shall go: but at present, as soon","As friend Scamp shall be pleased to step down from the moon,","(Where he seems to be soaring in search of his wits),","And an interval grants from his lecturing fits,","I'm engaged to the Lady Bluebottle's collation,","To partake of a luncheon and learn'd conversation:","'Tis a sort of reunion for Scamp, on the days","Of his lecture, to treat him with cold tongue and praise.","And I own, for my own part, that 'tis not unpleasant.","Will you go? There's Miss Lilac will also be present.","","_Tra_. That \"metal's attractive.\"","","_Ink_.                           No doubt--to the pocket.","","_Tra_. You should rather encourage my passion than shock it.","But let us proceed; for I think by the hum----","","_Ink_. Very true; let us go, then, before they can come,","Or else we'll be kept here an hour at their levee,","On the rack of cross questions, by all the blue bevy.","Hark! Zounds, they'll be on us; I know by the drone","Of old Botherby's spouting ex-cathedrâ tone.","Aye! there he is at it. Poor Scamp! better join","Your friends, or he'll pay you back in your own coin.","","_Tra_. All fair; 'tis but lecture for lecture.","","_Ink_.                                         That's clear.","But for God's sake let's go, or the Bore will be here.","Come, come: nay, I'm off.","                                                        [_Exit_ INKEL.","","_Tra_.

Because","I defy him to beat this day's wondrous applause.","The very walls shook.","","_Ink_.

No reason whatever, save that he's a sot.","Lady Bluemount! a glass of Madeira?","","_Lady Bluem_.                      With pleasure.","","_Ink_. How does your friend Wordswords, that Windermere treasure?","Does he stick to his lakes, like the leeches he sings,","And their gatherers, as Homer sung warriors and kings?","","_Lady Bluem_.

Never mind if he did; 'twill be seen","That whatever he means won't alloy what he says.","","_Both_. Sir!","","_Ink_.

It would be your perdition.","While you live, my dear Botherby, never defend","Yourself or your works; but leave both to a friend.","Apropos--Is your play then accepted at last?","","_Both_. At last?","","_Ink_. Why I thought--that's to say--there had passed","A few green-room whispers, which hinted,--you know","That the taste of the actors at best is so so.","","_Both_. Sir, the green-room's in rapture, and so's the Committee.","","_Ink_. Aye--yours are the plays for exciting our \"pity","And fear,\" as the Greek says: for \"purging the mind,\"","I doubt if you'll leave us an equal behind.","","_Both_. I have written the prologue, and meant to have prayed","For a spice of your wit in an epilogue's aid.","","_Ink_. Well, time enough yet, when the play's to be played.","Is it cast yet?","","_Both_.         The actors are fighting for parts,","As is usual in that most litigious of arts.","","_Lady Blueb_. We'll all make a party, and go the _first_ night.","","_Tra_. And you promised the epilogue, Inkel.","","_Ink_.                                       Not quite.","However, to save my friend Botherby trouble,","I'll do what I can, though my pains must be double.","","_Tra_. Why so?","","_Ink_.          To do justice to what goes before.","","_Both_. Sir, I'm happy to say, I've no fears on that score.","Your parts, Mr. Inkel, are----","","_Ink_.                    Never mind _mine_;","Stick to those of your play, which is quite your own line.","","_Lady Bluem_. You're a fugitive writer, I think, sir, of rhymes?","","_Ink_. Yes, ma'am; and a fugitive reader sometimes.","On Wordswords, for instance, I seldom alight,","Or on Mouthey, his friend, without taking to flight.","","_Lady Bluem_. Sir, your taste is too common; but time and posterity","Will right these great men, and this age's severity","Become its reproach.","","_Ink_.               I've no sort of objection,","So I'm not of the party to take the infection.","","_Lady Blueb_. Perhaps you have doubts that they ever will _take_?","","_Ink_. Not at all; on the contrary, those of the lake","Have taken already, and still will continue","To take--what they can, from a groat to a guinea,","Of pension or place;--but the subject's a bore.","","_Lady Bluem_. Well, sir, the time's coming.","","_Ink_.                                   Scamp! don't you feel sore?","What say you to this?","","_Scamp_.             They have merit, I own;","Though their system's absurdity keeps it unknown,","","_Ink_. Then why not unearth it in one of your lectures?","","_Scamp_. It is only time past which comes under my strictures.","","_Lady Blueb_. Come, a truce with all tartness;--the joy of my heart","Is to see Nature's triumph o'er all that is art.","Wild Nature!--Grand Shakespeare!","","_Both_.                         And down Aristotle!","","_Lady Bluem_. Sir George thinks exactly with Lady Bluebottle:","And my Lord Seventy-four, who protects our dear Bard,","And who gave him his place, has the greatest regard","For the poet, who, singing of pedlers and asses,","Has found out the way to dispense with Parnassus.","","_Tra_. And you, Scamp!--","","_Scamp_.                I needs must confess I'm embarrassed.","","_Ink_. Don't call upon Scamp, who's already so harassed","With old _schools_, and new _schools_,","                         and no _schools_, and all _schools_.","","_Tra_. Well, one thing is certain, that _some_ must be fools.","I should like to know who.","","_Ink_.                   And I should not be sorry","To know who are _not_:--it would save us some worry.","","_Lady Blueb_. A truce with remark, and let nothing control","This \"feast of our reason, and flow of the soul.\"","Oh! my dear Mr. Botherby! sympathise!--I","Now feel such a rapture, I'm ready to fly,","I feel so elastic--\"_so buoyant--so buoyant!_\"","","_Ink_. Tracy! open the window.","","_Tra_.                         I wish her much joy on't.","","_Both_. For God's sake, my Lady Bluebottle, check not","This gentle emotion, so seldom our lot","Upon earth. Give it way: 'tis an impulse which lifts","Our spirits from earth--the sublimest of gifts;","For which poor Prometheus was chained to his mountain:","'Tis the source of all sentiment--feeling's true fountain;","'Tis the Vision of Heaven upon Earth: 'tis the gas","Of the soul: 'tis the seizing of shades as they pass,","And making them substance: 'tis something divine:--","","_Ink_. Shall I help you, my friend, to a little more wine?","","_Both_. I thank you: not any more, sir, till I dine.","","_Ink_. Apropos--Do you dine with Sir Humphry to day?","","_Tra_. I should think with _Duke_ Humphry was more in your way.","","_Ink_. It might be of yore; but we authors now look","To the Knight, as a landlord, much more than the Duke.","The truth is, each writer now quite at his ease is,","And (except with his publisher) dines where he pleases.","But 'tis now nearly five, and I must to the Park.","","_Tra_. And I'll take a turn with you there till 'tis dark.","And you, Scamp--","","_Scamp_.          Excuse me! I must to my notes,","For my lecture next week.","","_Ink_. He must mind whom he quotes","Out of \"Elegant Extracts.\"","","_Lady Blueb_.             Well, now we break up;","But remember Miss Diddle invites us to sup.","","_Ink_. Then at two hours past midnight we all meet again,","For the sciences, sandwiches, hock, and champagne!","","_Tra_. And the sweet lobster salad!","","_Both_.                               I honour that meal;","For 'tis then that our feelings most genuinely--feel.","","_Ink_. True; feeling is truest _then_, far beyond question:","I wish to the gods 'twas the same with digestion!","","_Lady Blueb_. Pshaw!--never mind that; for one moment of feeling","Is worth--God knows what.","","_Ink_.

branches of the holy oak,","Horror, confusion, fear, and torment brake;","And still when midnight trims her mazy lamp,","They take their way through Tiber's wat'ry swamp.","On Tiber's banks, close ranked, a warring train,","Stretch'd to the distant edge of Galca's plain;","So when arrived at Gaigra's highest steep,","We view the wide expansion of the deep;","See in the gilding of her wat'ry robe,","The quick declension of the circling globe;","From the blue sea a chain of mountains rise,","Blended at once with water and with skies;","Beyond our sight in vast extension curl'd,","The check of waves, the guardians of the world.","Strong were the warriors, as the ghost of Cawn,","Who threw the Hill-of-archers to the lawn;","When the soft earth at his appearance fled;","And rising billows play'd around his head;","When a strong tempest rising from the main,","Dashed the full clouds, unbroken on the plain.","Nicou, immortal in the sacred song,","Held the red sword of war, and led the strong;","From his own tribe the sable warriors came,","Well try'd in battle, and well known in fame.","Nicou, descended from the god of war,","Who lived coeval with the morning star;","Narada was his name; who cannot tell","How all the world through great Narada fell!","Vichon, the god who ruled above the skies,","Look'd, on Narada, but with envious eyes;","The warrior dared him, ridiculed his might,","Bent his white bow, and summon'd him to fight.","Vichon, disdainful, bade his lightnings fly,","And scatter'd burning arrows in the sky;","Threw down a star the armour of his feet,","To burn the air with supernat'ral heat;","Bid a loud tempes roar beneath the ground;","Lifted him up, and bore him thro' the sea.","The waters still ascending fierce and high,","He tower'd into the chambers of the sky;","There Vichon sat, his armour on his bed,","He thought Narada with the mighty dead.","Before his seat the heavenly warrior stands,","The lightning quiv'ring in his yellow hands.","The god astonish'd dropt; hurl'd from the shore,","He dropt to torments, and to rise no more.","","Head-long he falls; 'tis his own arms compel.","Condemn'd in ever-burning fires to dwell.","From this Narada, mighty Nicou sprung;","The mighty Nicou, furious, wild and young.","Who led th'embattled archers to the field,","And more a thunderbolt upon his shield;","That shield his glorious father died to gain,","When the white warriors fled along the plain,","When the full sails could not provoke the flood,","Till Nicou came and swell'd the seas with blood.","Slow at the end of his robust array,","The mighty warrior pensive took his way;","Against the son of Nair, the young Rorest,","Once the companion of his youthful breast.","Strong were the passions of the son of Nair,","Strong, as the tempest of the evening air.","Insatiate in desire; fierce as the boar;","Firm in resolve as Cannie's rocky shore.","Long had the gods endeavour'd to destroy,","All Nicou's friendship, happiness, and joy:","They sought in vain, 'till Vicat, Vichon's son,","Never in feats of wickedness outdone,","Saw Nica, sister to the Mountain king,","Drest beautiful, with all the flow'rs of spring;","He saw, and scatter'd poison in her eyes;","From limb to limb in varied forms he flies;","Dwelt on her crimson lip, and added grace","To every glossy feature of her face.","Rorest was fir'd with passion at the sight.","Friendship and honor, sunk to Vicat's right;","He saw, he lov'd, and burning with desire,","Bore the soft maid from brother, sister, sire.","Pining with sorrow, Nica faded, died,","Like a fair alow, in its morning pride.","This brought the warrior to the bloody mead,","And sent to young Rorest the threat'ning reed.","He drew his army forth: Oh, need I tell!","That Nicou conquer'd, and the lover fell;","His breathless army mantled all the plain;","And Death sat smiling on the heaps of slain.","The battle ended, with his reeking dart,","The pensive Nicou pierc'd his beating heart;","And to his mourning valiant warriors cry'd,","I, and my sister's ghost are satisfy'd."],"linecount":"122"},{"title":"The Pumpkin","author":"John Greenleaf Whittier","lines":["Oh, greenly and

it renovate his soul;","Then shall sorrow sink to sleep,","And he who wept, no more shall weep;","For his care-clouded brow shall clear,","And his glad eye shall sparkle thro' the tear.","","When the poor man heart-opprest","Betakes him to his evening rest,","And worn with labour thinks in sorrow","Of the labor of to-morrow;","When sadly musing on his lot","He hies him to his joyless cot,","And loathes to meet his children there,","The rivals for his scanty fare:","Oh give to him the flowing bowl,","Bid it renovate his soul;","The generous juice with magic power","Shall cheat with happiness the hour,","And with each warm affection fill","The heart by want and wretchedness made chill.","","When, at the dim close of day,","The Captive loves alone to stray","Along the haunts recluse and rude","Of sorrow and of solitude;","When he sits with moveless eye","To mark the lingering radiance die,","And lets distemper'd Fancy roam","Amid the ruins of his home,--","Oh give to him the flowing bowl,","Bid it renovate his soul;","The bowl shall better thoughts bestow,","And lull to rest his wakeful woe,","And Joy shall bless the evening hour,","And make the Captive Fortune's conqueror.","","When the wearying cares of state","Oppress the Monarch with their weight,","When from his pomp retir'd alone","He feels the duties of the throne,","Feels that the multitude below","Depend on him for weal or woe;","When his powerful will may bless","A realm with peace and happiness,","Or with desolating breath","Breathe ruin round, and woe, and death:","Oh give to him the flowing bowl,","Bid it humanize his soul;","He shall not feel the empire's weight,","He shall not feel the cares of state,","The bowl shall each dark thought beguile,","And Nations live and prosper from his smile.","","Husht was the lute, the Hebrew ceas'd the song;","Long peals of plaudits echoed from the throng;","Each tongue the liberal words of praise repaid,","On every cheek a smile applauding play'd;","The rival Bard advanced, he struck the string,","And pour'd the loftier song to Persia's King.","","Why should the wearying cares of state","Oppress the Monarch with their weight?","Alike to him if Peace shall bless","The multitude with happiness;","Alike to him if frenzied War","Careers triumphant on the embattled plain,","And rolling on o'er myriads slain,","With gore and wounds shall clog his scythed car.","What tho' the tempest rage! no sound","Of the deep thunder shakes his distant throne,","And the red flash that spreads destruction round,","Reflects a glorious splendour on the Crown.","","Where is the Man who with ennobling pride","Beholds not his own nature? where is he","Who but with deep amazement awe allied","Must muse the mysteries of the human mind,","The miniature of Deity.","For Man the vernal clouds descending","Shower down their fertilizing rain,","For Man the ripen'd harvest bending","Waves with soft murmur o'er the plenteous plain.","He spreads the sail on high,","The rude gale wafts him o'er the main;","For him the winds of Heaven subservient blow,","Earth teems for him, for him the waters flow,","He thinks, and wills, and acts, a Deity below!","","Where is the King who with elating pride","Sees not this Man--this godlike Man his Slave?","Mean are the mighty by the Monarch's side,","Alike the wife, alike the brave","With timid step and pale, advance,","And tremble at the royal glance;","Suspended millions watch his breath","Whose smile is happiness, whose frown is death.","","Why goes the Peasant from that little cot,","Where PEACE and LOVE have blest his humble life?","In vain his agonizing wife","With tears bedews her husband's face,","And clasps him in a long and last embrace;","In vain his children round his bosom creep,","And weep to see their mother weep,","Fettering their father with their little arms;","What are to him the wars alarms?","What are to him the distant foes?","He at the earliest dawn of day","To daily labor went his way;","And when he saw the sun decline,","He sat in peace beneath his vine:--","The king commands, the peasant goes,","From all he lov'd on earth he flies,","And for his monarch toils, and fights, and bleeds, and dies.","","What tho' yon City's castled wall","Casts o'er the darken'd plain its crested shade?","What tho' their Priests in earnest terror call","On all their host of Gods to aid?","Vain is the bulwark, vain the tower;","In vain her gallant youths expose","Their breasts, a bulwark, to the foes.","In vain at that tremendous hour,","Clasp'd in the savage soldier's reeking arms,","Shrieks to tame Heaven the violated Maid.","By the rude hand of Ruin scatter'd round","Their moss-grown towers shall spread the desart ground.","Low shall the mouldering palace lie,","Amid the princely halls the grass wave high,","And thro' the shatter'd roof descend the inclement sky.","","Gay o'er the embattled plain","Moves yonder warrior train,","Their banners wanton on the morning gale!","Full on their bucklers beams the rising ray,","Their glittering helmets flash a brighter day,","The shout of war rings echoing o'er the vale:","Far reaches as the aching eye can strain","The splendid horror of their wide array.","Ah! not in vain expectant, o'er","Their glorious pomp the Vultures soar!","Amid the Conqueror's palace high","Shall sound the song of victory:","Long after journeying o'er the plain","The Traveller shall with startled eye","See their white bones then blanched by many a winter sky.","","Lord of the Earth! we will not raise","The Temple to thy bounded praise.","For thee no victim need expire,","For thee no altar blaze with hallowed fire!","The burning city flames for thee--","Thine altar is the field of victory!","Thy sacred Majesty to bless","Man a self-offer'd victim freely flies;","To thee he sacrifices Happiness,","And Peace, and Love's endearing ties,","To thee a Slave he lives, to thee a Slave he dies.","","","Husht was the lute, the Hebrew ceas'd to sing;","The shout rush'd forth--for ever live the King!","Loud was the uproar, as when Rome's decree","Pronounc'd Achaia once again was free;","Assembled Greece enrapt with fond belief","Heard the false boon, and bless'd the villain Chief;","Each breast with Freedom's holy ardor glows,","From every voice the cry of rapture rose;","Their thundering clamors burst the astonish'd sky,","And birds o'erpassing hear, and drop, and die.","Thus o'er the Persian dome their plaudits ring,","And the high hall re-echoed--live the King!","The Mutes bow'd reverent down before their Lord,","The assembled Satraps envied and ador'd,","Joy sparkled in the Monarch's conscious eyes,","And his pleas'd pride already doom'd the prize.","","Silent they saw Zorobabel advance:","Quick on Apame shot his timid glance,","With downward eye he paus'd a moment mute,","And with light finger touch'd the softer lute.","Apame knew the Hebrew's grateful cause,","And bent her head and sweetly smil'd applause.","","Why is the Warrior's cheek so red?","Why downward droops his musing head?","Why that slow step, that faint advance,","That keen yet quick-retreating glance?","That crested head in war tower'd high,","No backward glance disgrac'd that eye,","No flushing fear that cheek o'erspread","When stern he strode o'er heaps of dead;","Strange tumult now his bosom moves--","The Warrior fears because he loves.","","Why does the Youth delight to rove","Amid the dark and lonely grove?","Why in the throng where all are gay,","His wandering eye with meaning fraught,","Sits he alone in silent thought?","Silent he sits; for far away","His passion'd soul delights to stray;","Recluse he roves and strives to shun","All human-kind because he loves but One!","","Yes, King of Persia, thou art blest;","But not because the sparkling bowl","To rapture lifts thy waken'd soul","But not because of Power possest,","Not that the Nations dread thy nod,","And Princes reverence thee their earthly God,","Even on a Monarch's solitude","Care the black Spectre will intrude,","The bowl brief pleasure can bestow,","The Purple cannot shield from Woe.","But King of Persia thou art blest,","For Heaven who rais'd thee thus the world above","Has made thee happy in Apame's love!","","Oh! I have seen his fond looks trace","Each angel feature of her face,","Rove o'er her form with eager eye,","And sigh and gaze, and gaze and sigh.","Lo! from his brow with mimic frown,","Apame takes the sacred crown;","Her faultless form, her lovely face","Add to the diadem new grace","And subject to a Woman's laws","Darius sees and smiles applause!","","He ceas'd, and silent still remain'd the throng","Whilst rapt attention own'd the power of song.","Then loud as when the wintry whirlwinds blow","From ev'ry voice the thundering plaudits flow;","Darius smil'd, Apame's sparkling eyes","Glanc'd on the King, and Woman won the prize.","","Now silent sat the expectant crowd, alone","The victor Hebrew gaz'd not on the throne;","With deeper hue his cheek distemper'd glows,","With statelier stature, loftier now he rose;","Heavenward he gaz'd, regardless of the throng,","And pour'd with awful voice sublimer song.","","Ancient of Days! Eternal Truth! one hymn","One holier strain the Bard shall raise to thee,","Thee Powerful! Thee Benevolent! Thee Just!","Friend! Father! All in All! the Vines rich blood,","The Monarch's might, and Woman's conquering charms,--","These shall we praise alone?

In that day","Thou shalt tell all thy days and hours, and tell","Thy times and ways and words of love, and say","How one was dear and one desirable,","And sweet was life to hear and sweet to smell,","But now with lights reverse the old hours retire","And the last hour is shod with fire from hell;","This is the end of every man's desire.","","The burden of four seasons. Rain in spring,","White rain and wind among the tender trees;","A summer of green sorrows gathering,","Rank autumn in a mist of miseries,","With sad face set towards the year, that sees","The charred ash drop out of the dropping pyre,","And winter wan with many maladies;","This is the end of every man's desire.","","The burden of dead faces. Out of sight","And out of love, beyond the reach of hands,","Changed in the changing of the dark and light,","They walk and weep about the barren lands","Where no seed is nor any garner stands,","Where in short breaths the doubtful days respire,","And time's turned glass lets through the sighing sands;","This is the end of every man's desire.","","The burden of much gladness. Life and lust","Forsake thee, and the face of thy delight;","And underfoot the heavy hour strews dust,","And overhead strange weathers burn and bite;","And where the red was, lo the bloodless white,","And where the truth was, the likeness of a liar,","And where the day was, the likeness of the night;","This is the end of every man's desire.","","L'ENVOY","","Princes, and ye whom pleasure

Oh how sweet,","And round your equal Fires do meet;","Whose shrill report no Ear can tell,","But Ecchoes to the Eye and smell.","See how the Flow'rs, as at Parade,","Under their Colours stand displaid:","Each Regiment in order grows,","That of the Tulip Pinke and Rose.","","But when the vigilant Patroul","Of Stars walks round about the Pole,","Their Leaves, that to the stalks are curl'd,","Seem to their Staves the Ensigns furl'd.","Then in some Flow'rs beloved Hut","Each Bee as Sentinel is shut;","And sleeps so too: but, if once stir'd,","She runs you through, or askes The

if not flaming Sword;","What luckless Apple did we tast,","To make us Mortal, and The Wast.","","Unhappy! shall we never more","That sweet Milltia restore,","When Gardens only had their Towrs,","And all the Garrisons were Flow'rs,","When Roses only Arms might bear,","And Men did rosie Garlands wear?","Tulips, in several Colours barr'd,","Were then the Switzers of our Guard.","","The Gardiner had the Souldiers place,","And his more gentle Forts did trace.","The Nursery of all things green","Was then the only Magazeen.","The Winter Quarters were the Stoves,","Where he the tender Plants removes.","But War all this doth overgrow:","We Ord'nance Plant and Powder sow.","","And yet their walks one on the Sod","Who, had it pleased him and God,","Might once have made our Gardens spring","Fresh as his own and flourishing.","But he preferr'd to the Cinque Ports","These five imaginary Forts:","And, in those half-dry Trenches, spann'd","Pow'r which the Ocean might command.","","For he did, with his utmost Skill,","Ambition weed, but Conscience till.","Conscience, that Heaven-nursed Plant,","Which most our Earthly Gardens want.","A prickling leaf it bears, and such","As that which shrinks at ev'ry touch;","But Flow'rs eternal, and divine,","That in the Crowns of Saints do shine.","","The sight does from these Bastions ply,","Th' invisible Artilery;","And at proud Cawood Castle seems","To point the Battery of its Beams.","As if it quarrell'd in the Seat","Th' Ambition of its Prelate great.","But ore the Meads below it plays,","Or innocently seems to gaze.","","And now to the Abbyss I pass","Of that unfathomable Grass,","Where Men like Grashoppers appear,","But Grashoppers are Gyants there:","They, in there squeking Laugh, contemn","Us as we walk more low then them:","And, from the Precipices tall","Of the green spir's, to us do call.","","To see Men through this Meadow Dive,","We wonder how they rise alive.","As, under Water, none does know","Whether he fall through it or go.","But, as the Marriners that sound,","And show upon their Lead the Ground,","They bring up Flow'rs so to be seen,","And prove they've at the Bottom been.","","No Scene that turns with Engines strange","Does oftner then these Meadows change,","For when the Sun the Grass hath vext,","The tawny Mowers enter next;","Who seem like Israaliies to be,","Walking on foot through a green Sea.","To them the Grassy Deeps divide,","And crowd a Lane to either Side.","","With whistling Sithe, and Elbow strong,","These Massacre the Grass along:","While one, unknowing, carves the Rail,","Whose yet unfeather'd Quils her fail.","The Edge all bloody from its Breast","He draws, and does his stroke detest;","Fearing the Flesh untimely mow'd","To him a Fate as black forebode.","","But bloody Thestylis, that waites","To bring the mowing Camp their Cates,","Greedy as Kites has trust it up,","And forthwith means on it to sup:","When on another quick She lights,","And cryes, he call'd us Israelites;","But now, to make his saying true,","Rails rain for Quails, for Manna Dew.","","Unhappy Birds! what does it boot","To build below the Grasses Root;","When Lowness is unsafe as Hight,","And Chance o'retakes what scapeth spight?","And now your Orphan Parents Call","Sounds your untimely Funeral.","Death-Trumpets creak in such a Note,","And 'tis the Sourdine in their Throat.","","Or sooner hatch or higher build:","The Mower now commands the Field;","In whose new Traverse seemeth wrought","A Camp of Battail newly fought:","Where, as the Meads with Hay, the Plain","Lyes quilted ore with Bodies slain:","The Women that with forks it filing,","Do represent the Pillaging.","","And now the careless Victors play,","Dancing the Triumphs of the Hay;","Where every Mowers wholesome Heat","Smells like an Alexanders Sweat.","Their Females fragrant as the Mead","Which they in Fairy Circles tread:","When at their Dances End they kiss,","Their

Memphis Sand,","Short Pyramids of Hay do stand.","And such the Roman Camps do rise","In Hills for Soldiers Obsequies.","","This Scene again withdrawing brings","A new and empty Face of things;","A levell'd space, as smooth and plain,","As Clothes for Lilly strecht to stain.","The World when first created sure","Was such a Table rase and pure.","Or rather such is the Toril","Ere the Bulls enter at Madril.","","For to this naked equal Flat,","Which Levellers take Pattern at,","The Villagers in common chase","Their Cattle, which it closer rase;","And what below the Sith increast","Is pincht yet nearer by the Breast.","Such, in the painted World, appear'd","Davenant with th'Universal Heard.","","They seem within the polisht Grass","A landskip drawen in Looking-Glass.","And shrunk in the

do kick,","Turn'd as they hang to Leeches quick;","How Boats can over Bridges sail;","And Fishes do the Stables scale.","How Salmons trespassing are found;","And Pikes are taken in the Pound.","","But I, retiring from the Flood,","Take Sanctuary in the Wood;","And, while it lasts, my self imbark","In this yet green, yet growing Ark;","Where the first Carpenter might best","Fit Timber for his Keel have Prest.","And where all Creatures might have shares,","Although in Armies, not in Paires.","","The double Wood of ancient Stocks","Link'd in so thick, an Union locks,","It like two Pedigrees

loose an order grows,","As the Corinthean Porticoes.","The Arching Boughs unite between","The Columnes of the Temple green;","And underneath the winged Quires","Echo about their tuned Fires.","","The Nightingale does here make choice","To sing the Tryals of her Voice.","Low Shrubs she sits in, and adorns","With Musick high the squatted Thorns.","But highest Oakes stoop down to hear,","And listning Elders prick the Ear.","The Thorn, lest it should hurt her, draws","Within the Skin its shrunken claws.","","But I have for my Musick found","A Sadder, yet more pleasing Sound:","The Stock-doves whose fair necks are grac'd","With Nuptial Rings their Ensigns chast;","Yet always, for some Cause unknown,","Sad pair unto the Elms they moan.","O why should such a Couple mourn,","That in so equal Flames do burn!","","Then as I carless on the Bed","Of gelid Straw-berryes do tread,","And through the Hazles thick espy","The hatching Thrastles shining Eye,","The Heron from the Ashes top,","The eldest of its young lets drop,","As if it Stork-like did pretend","That Tribute to its Lord to send.","","But most the Hewel's wonders are,","Who here has the Holt-felsters care.","He walks still upright from the Root,","Meas'ring the Timber with his Foot;","And all the way, to keep it clean,","Doth from the Bark the Wood-moths glean.","He, with his Beak, examines well","Which fit to stand and which to fell.","","The good he numbers up, and hacks;","As if he mark'd them with the Ax.","But where he, tinkling with his Beak,","Does find the hollow Oak to speak,","That for his building he designs,","And through the tainted Side he mines.","Who could have thought the tallest Oak","Should fall by such a feeble Strok'!","","Nor would it, had the Tree not fed","A Traitor-worm, within it bred.","(As first our Flesh corrupt within","Tempts impotent and bashful Sin.","And yet that Worm triumphs not long,","But serves to feed the Hewels young.","While the Oake seems to fall content,","Viewing the Treason's Punishment.","","Thus I, easie Philosopher,","Among the Birds and Trees confer:","And little now to make me, wants","Or of the Fowles, or of the Plants.","Give me but Wings as they, and I","Streight floting on the Air shall fly:","Or turn me but, and you shall see","I was but an inverted Tree.","","Already I begin to call","In their most-learned Original:","And where I Language want,my Signs","The Bird upon the Bough divines;","And more attentive there doth sit","Then if She were with Lime-twigs knit.","No Leaf does tremble in the Wind","Which I returning cannot find.","","Out of these scatter'd Sibyls Leaves","Strange Prophecies my Phancy weaves:","And in one History consumes,","Like Mexique Paintings, all the Plumes.","What Rome, Greece, Palestine, ere said","I in this light Mosaick read.","Thrice happy he who, not mistook,","Hath read in Natures mystick Book.","","And see how Chance's better Wit","Could with a Mask my studies hit!","The Oak-Leaves me embroyder all,","Between which Caterpillars crawl:","And Ivy, with familiar trails,","Me licks, and clasps, and curles, and hales.","Under this antick Cope I move","Like some great Prelate of the Grove,","","Then, languishing with ease, I toss","On Pallets swoln of Velvet Moss;","While the Wind, cooling through the Boughs,","Flatters with Air my panting Brows.","Thanks for my Rest ye Mossy Banks,","And unto you cool Zephyr's Thanks,","Who, as my Hair, my Thoughts too shed,","And winnow from the Chaff my Head.","","How safe, methinks, and strong, behind","These Trees have I incamp'd my Mind;","Where Beauty, aiming at the Heart,","Bends in some Tree its useless Dart;","And where the World no certain Shot","Can make, or me it toucheth not.","But I on it securely play,","And gaul its Horsemen all the Day.","","Bind me ye Woodbines in your 'twines,","Curle me about ye gadding Vines,","And Oh so close your Circles lace,","That I may never leave this Place:","But, lest your Fetters prove too weak,","Ere I your Silken Bondage break,","Do you, O Brambles, chain me too,","And courteous Briars nail me though.","","Here in the Morning tye my Chain,","Where the two Woods have made a Lane;","While, like a Guard on either side,","The Trees before their Lord divide;","This, like a long and equal Thread,","Betwixt two Labyrinths does lead.","But, where the Floods did lately drown,","There at the Ev'ning stake me down.","","For now the Waves are fal'n and dry'd,","And now the Meadows fresher dy'd;","Whose Grass, with moister colour dasht,","Seems as green Silks but newly washt.","No Serpent new nor Crocodile","Remains behind our little Nile;","Unless it self you will mistake,","Among these Meads the only Snake.","","See in what wanton harmless folds","It ev'ry where the Meadow holds;","And its yet muddy back doth lick,","Till as a Chrystal Mirrour slick;","Where all things gaze themselves, and doubt","If they be in it or without.","And for his shade which therein shines,","Narcissus like, the Sun too pines.","","Oh what a Pleasure 'tis to hedge","My Temples here with heavy sedge;","Abandoning my lazy Side,","Stretcht as a Bank unto the Tide;","Or to suspend my sliding Foot","On the Osiers undermined Root,","And in its Branches tough to hang,","While at my Lines the Fishes twang!","","But now away my Hooks, my Quills,","And Angles, idle Utensils.","The Young Maria walks to night:","Hide trifling Youth thy Pleasures slight.","'Twere shame that such judicious Eyes","Should with such Toyes a Man surprize;","She that already is the Law","Of all her Sex, her Ages Aw.","","See how loose Nature, in respect","To her, it self doth recollect;","And every thing so whisht and fine,","Starts forth with to its Bonne Mine.","The Sun himself, of Her aware,","Seems to descend with greater Care,","And lest She see him go to Bed,","In blushing Clouds conceales his Head.","","So when the Shadows laid asleep","From underneath these Banks do creep,","And on the River as it flows","With Eben Shuts begin to close;","The modest Halcyon comes in sight,","Flying betwixt the Day and Night;","And such an horror calm and dumb,","Admiring Nature does benum.","","The viscous Air, wheres'ere She fly,","Follows and sucks her Azure dy;","The gellying Stream compacts below,","If it might fix her shadow so;","The Stupid Fishes hang, as plain","As Flies in Chrystal overt'ane,","And Men the silent Scene assist,","Charm'd with the saphir-winged Mist.","","Maria such, and so doth hush","The World, and through the Ev'ning rush.","No new-born Comet such a Train","Draws through the Skie, nor Star new-slain.","For streight those giddy Rockets fail,","Which from the putrid Earth exhale,","But by her Flames, in Heaven try'd,","Nature is wholly Vitrifi'd.","","'Tis She that to these Gardens gave","That wondrous Beauty which they have;","She streightness on the Woods bestows;","To Her the Meadow sweetness owes;","Nothing could make the River be","So Chrystal-pure but only She;","She yet more Pure, Sweet, Streight, and Fair,","Then Gardens, Woods, Meads, Rivers are.","","Therefore what first She on them spent,","They gratefully again present.","The Meadow Carpets where to tread;","The Garden Flow'rs to Crown Her Head;","And for a Glass the limpid Brook,","Where She may all her Beautyes look;","But, since She would not have them seen,","The Wood about her draws a Skreen.","","For She, to higher Beauties rais'd,","Disdains to be for lesser prais'd.","She counts her Beauty to converse","In all the Languages as hers;","Not yet in those her self imployes","But for the Wisdome, not the Noyse;","Nor yet that Wisdome would affect,","But as 'tis Heavens Dialect.","","Blest Nymph! that couldst so soon prevent","Those Trains by Youth against thee meant;","Tears (watry Shot that pierce the Mind;)","And Sighs (Loves Cannon charg'd with Wind;)","True Praise (That breaks through all defence;)","And feign'd complying Innocence;","But knowing where this Ambush lay,","She scap'd the safe, but roughest Way.","","This 'tis to have been from the first","In a Domestick Heaven nurst,","Under the Discipline severe","Of Fairfax, and the starry Vere;","Where not one object can come nigh","But pure, and spotless as the Eye;","And Goodness doth it self intail","On Females, if there want a Male.","","Go now fond Sex that on your Face","Do all your useless Study place,","Nor once at Vice your Brows dare knit","Lest the smooth Forehead wrinkled sit","Yet your own Face shall at you grin,","Thorough the Black-bag of your Skin;","When knowledge only could have fill'd","And Virtue all those Furows till'd.","","Hence She with Graces more divine","Supplies beyond her Sex the Line;","And, like a sprig of Misleto,","On the Fairfacian Oak does grow;","Whence, for some universal good,","The Priest shall cut the sacred Bud;","While her glad Parents most rejoice,","And make their Destiny their Choice.","","Mean time ye Fields, Springs, Bushes, Flow'rs,","Where yet She leads her studious Hours,","(Till Fate her worthily translates,","And find a Fairfax for our Thwaites)","Employ the means you have by Her,","And in

backward in a pensive dream,","And fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers","Plucked in the shy fields and distant Wychwood bowers,","And thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream.","","And then they land, and thou art seen no more!—","Maidens, who from the distant hamlets come","To dance around the Fyfield elm in May,","Oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam,","Or cross a stile into

hath words she can report of thee.","","And, above Godstow Bridge, when hay-time's here","In June, and many a scythe in sunshine flames,","Men who through those wide fields of breezy grass","Where

'My free leave,' he said;","'Get her to speak: she doth not speak to me.'","Then rose Limours, and looking at his feet,","Like him who tries the bridge he fears may fail,","Crost and came near, lifted adoring eyes,","Bowed at her side and uttered whisperingly:","","'Enid, the pilot star of my lone life,","Enid, my early and my only love,","Enid, the loss of whom hath turned me wild--","What chance is this? how is it I see you here?","Ye are in my power at last, are in my power.","Yet fear me not: I call mine own self wild,","But keep a touch of sweet civility","Here in the heart of waste and wilderness.","I thought, but that your father came between,","In former days you saw me favourably.","And if it were so do not keep it back:","Make me a little happier: let me know it:","Owe you me nothing for a life half-lost?","Yea, yea, the whole dear debt of all you are.","And, Enid, you and he, I see with joy,","Ye sit apart, you do not speak to him,","You come with no attendance, page or maid,","To serve you--doth he love you as of old?","For, call it lovers' quarrels, yet I know","Though men may bicker with the things they love,","They would not make them laughable in all eyes,","Not while they loved them; and your wretched dress,","A wretched insult on you, dumbly speaks","Your story, that this man loves you no more.","Your beauty is no beauty to him now:","A common chance--right well I know it--palled--","For I know men: nor will ye win him back,","For the man's love once gone never returns.","But here is one who loves you as of old;","With more exceeding passion than of old:","Good, speak the word: my followers ring him round:","He sits unarmed; I hold a finger up;","They understand: nay; I do not mean blood:","Nor need ye look so scared at what I say:","My malice is no deeper than a moat,","No stronger than a wall: there is the keep;","He shall not cross us more; speak but the word:","Or speak it not; but then by Him that made me","The one true lover whom you ever owned,","I will make use of all the power I have.","O pardon me! the madness of that hour,","When first I parted from thee, moves me yet.'","","At this the tender sound of his own voice","And sweet self-pity, or the fancy of it,","Made his eye moist; but Enid feared his eyes,","Moist as they were, wine-heated from the feast;","And answered with such craft as women use,","Guilty or guiltless, to stave off a chance","That breaks upon them perilously, and said:","","'Earl, if you love me as in former years,","And do not practise on me, come with morn,","And snatch me from him as by violence;","Leave me tonight: I am weary to the death.'","","Low at leave-taking, with his brandished plume","Brushing his instep, bowed the all-amorous Earl,","And the stout Prince bad him a loud good-night.","He moving homeward babbled to his men,","How Enid never loved a man but him,","Nor cared a broken egg-shell for her lord.","","But Enid left alone with Prince Geraint,","Debating his command of silence given,","And that she now perforce must violate it,","Held commune with herself, and while she held","He fell asleep, and Enid had no heart","To wake him, but hung o'er him, wholly pleased","To find him yet unwounded after fight,","And hear him breathing low and equally.","Anon she rose, and stepping lightly, heaped","The pieces of his armour in one place,","All to be there against a sudden need;","Then dozed awhile herself, but overtoiled","By that day's grief and travel, evermore","Seemed catching at a rootless thorn, and then","Went slipping down horrible precipices,","And strongly striking out her limbs awoke;","Then thought she heard the wild Earl at the door,","With all his rout of random followers,","Sound on a dreadful trumpet, summoning her;","Which was the red cock shouting to the light,","As the gray dawn stole o'er the dewy world,","And glimmered on his armour in the room.","And once again she rose to look at it,","But touched it unawares: jangling, the casque","Fell, and he started up and stared at her.","Then breaking his command of silence given,","She told him all that Earl Limours had said,","Except the passage that he loved her not;","Nor left untold the craft herself had used;","But ended with apology so sweet,","Low-spoken, and of so few words, and seemed","So justified by that necessity,","That though he thought 'was it for him she wept","In Devon?' he but gave a wrathful groan,","Saying, 'Your sweet faces make good fellows fools","And traitors. Call the host and bid him bring","Charger and palfrey.' So she glided out","Among the heavy breathings of the house,","And like a household Spirit at the walls","Beat, till she woke the sleepers, and returned:","Then tending her rough lord, though all unasked,","In silence, did him service as a squire;","Till issuing armed he found the host and cried,","'Thy reckoning, friend?' and ere he learnt it, 'Take","Five horses and their armours;' and the host","Suddenly honest, answered in amaze,","'My lord, I scarce have spent the worth of one!'","'Ye will be all the wealthier,' said the Prince,","And then to Enid, 'Forward! and today","I charge you, Enid, more especially,","What thing soever ye may hear, or see,","Or fancy (though I count it of small use","To charge you) that ye speak not but obey.'","","And Enid answered, 'Yea, my lord, I know","Your wish, and would obey; but riding first,","I hear the violent threats you do not hear,","I see the danger which you cannot see:","Then not to give you warning, that seems hard;","Almost beyond me: yet I would obey.'","","'Yea so,' said he, 'do it: be not too wise;","Seeing that ye are wedded to a man,","Not all mismated with a yawning clown,","But one with arms to guard his head and yours,","With eyes to find you out however far,","And ears to hear you even in his dreams.'","","With that he turned and looked as keenly at her","As careful robins eye the delver's toil;","And that within her, which a wanton fool,","Or hasty judger would have called her guilt,","Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall.","And Geraint looked and was not satisfied.","","Then forward by a way which, beaten broad,","Led from the territory of false Limours","To the waste earldom of another earl,","Doorm, whom his shaking vassals called the Bull,","Went Enid with her sullen follower on.","Once she looked back, and when she saw him ride","More near by many a rood than yestermorn,","It wellnigh made her cheerful; till Geraint","Waving an angry hand as who should say","'Ye watch me,' saddened all her heart again.","But while the sun yet beat a dewy blade,","The sound of many a heavily-galloping hoof","Smote on her ear, and turning round she saw","Dust, and the points of lances bicker in it.","Then not to disobey her lord's behest,","And yet to give him warning, for he rode","As if he heard not, moving back she held","Her finger up, and pointed to the dust.","At which the warrior in his obstinacy,","Because she kept the letter of his word,","Was in a manner pleased, and turning, stood.","And in the moment after, wild Limours,","Borne on a black horse, like a thunder-cloud","Whose skirts are loosened by the breaking storm,","Half ridden off with by the thing he rode,","And all in passion uttering a dry shriek,","Dashed down on Geraint, who closed with him, and bore","Down by the length of lance and arm beyond","The crupper, and so left him stunned or dead,","And overthrew the next that followed him,","And blindly rushed on all the rout behind.","But at the flash and motion of the man","They vanished panic-stricken, like a shoal","Of darting fish, that on a summer morn","Adown the crystal dykes at Camelot","Come slipping o'er their shadows on the sand,","But if a man who stands upon the brink","But lift a shining hand against the sun,","There is not left the twinkle of a fin","Betwixt the cressy islets white in flower;","So, scared but at the motion of the man,","Fled all the boon companions of the Earl,","And left him lying in the public way;","So vanish friendships only made in wine.","","Then like a stormy sunlight smiled Geraint,","Who saw the chargers of the two that fell","Start from their fallen lords, and wildly fly,","Mixt with the flyers. 'Horse and man,' he said,","'All of one mind and all right-honest friends!","Not a hoof left: and I methinks till now","Was honest--paid with horses and with arms;","I cannot steal or plunder, no nor beg:","And so what say ye, shall we strip him there","Your lover? has your palfrey heart enough","To bear his armour? shall we fast, or dine?","No?--then do thou, being right honest, pray","That we may meet the horsemen of Earl Doorm,","I too would still be honest.' Thus he said:","And sadly gazing on her bridle-reins,","And answering not one word, she led the way.","","But as a man to whom a dreadful loss","Falls in a far land and he knows it not,","But coming back he learns it, and the loss","So pains him that he sickens nigh to death;","So fared it with Geraint, who being pricked","In combat with the follower of Limours,","Bled underneath his armour secretly,","And so rode on, nor told his gentle wife","What ailed him, hardly knowing it himself,","Till his eye darkened and his helmet wagged;","And at a sudden swerving of the road,","Though happily down on a bank of grass,","The Prince, without a word, from his horse fell.","","And Enid heard the clashing of his fall,","Suddenly came, and at his side all pale","Dismounting, loosed the fastenings of his arms,","Nor let her true hand falter, nor blue eye","Moisten, till she had lighted on his wound,","And tearing off her veil of faded silk","Had bared her forehead to the blistering sun,","And swathed the hurt that drained her dear lord's life.","Then after all was done that hand could do,","She rested, and her desolation came","Upon her, and she wept beside the way.","","And many past, but none regarded her,","For in that realm of lawless turbulence,","A woman weeping for her murdered mate","Was cared as much for as a summer shower:","One took him for a victim of Earl Doorm,","Nor dared to waste a perilous pity on him:","Another hurrying past, a man-at-arms,","Rode on a mission to the bandit Earl;","Half whistling and half singing a coarse song,","He drove the dust against her veilless eyes:","Another, flying from the wrath of Doorm","Before an ever-fancied arrow, made","The long way smoke beneath him in his fear;","At which her palfrey whinnying lifted heel,","And scoured into the coppices and was lost,","While the great charger stood, grieved like a man.","","But at the point of noon the huge Earl Doorm,","Broad-faced with under-fringe of russet beard,","Bound on a foray, rolling eyes of prey,","Came riding with a hundred lances up;","But ere he came, like one that hails a ship,","Cried out with a big voice, 'What, is he dead?'","'No, no, not dead!' she answered in all haste.","'Would some of your people take him up,","And bear him hence out of this cruel sun?","Most sure am I, quite sure, he is not dead.'","","Then said Earl Doorm: 'Well, if he be not dead,","Why wail ye for him thus? ye seem a child.","And be he dead, I count you for a fool;","Your wailing will not quicken him: dead or not,","Ye mar a comely face with idiot tears.","Yet, since the face IS comely--some of you,","Here, take him up, and bear him to our hall:","An if he live, we will have him of our band;","And if he die, why earth has earth enough","To hide him. See ye take the charger too,","A noble one.'","He spake, and past away,","But left two brawny spearmen, who advanced,","Each growling like a dog, when his good bone","Seems to be plucked at by the village boys","Who love to vex him eating, and he fears","To lose his bone, and lays his foot upon it,","Gnawing and growling: so the ruffians growled,","Fearing to lose, and all for a dead man,","Their chance of booty from the morning's raid,","Yet raised and laid him on a litter-bier,","Such as they brought upon their forays out","For those that might be wounded; laid him on it","All in the hollow of his shield, and took","And bore him to the naked hall of Doorm,","(His gentle charger following him unled)","And cast him and the bier in which he lay","Down on an oaken settle in the hall,","And then departed, hot in haste to join","Their luckier mates, but growling as before,","And cursing their lost time, and the dead man,","And their own Earl, and their own souls, and her.","They might as well have blest her: she was deaf","To blessing or to cursing save from one.","","So for long hours sat Enid by her lord,","There in the naked hall, propping his head,","And chafing his pale hands, and calling to him.","Till at the last he wakened from his swoon,","And found his own dear bride propping his head,","And chafing his faint hands, and calling to him;","And felt the warm tears falling on his face;","And said to his own heart, 'She weeps for me:'","And yet lay still, and feigned himself as dead,","That he might prove her to the uttermost,","And say to his own heart, 'She weeps for me.'","","But in the falling afternoon returned","The huge Earl Doorm with plunder to the hall.","His lusty spearmen followed him with noise:","Each hurling down a heap of things that rang","Against his pavement, cast his lance aside,","And doffed his helm: and then there fluttered in,","Half-bold, half-frighted, with dilated eyes,","A tribe of women, dressed in many hues,","And mingled with the spearmen: and Earl Doorm","Struck with a knife's haft hard against the board,","And called for flesh and wine to feed his spears.","And men brought in whole hogs and quarter beeves,","And all the hall was dim with steam of flesh:","And none spake word, but all sat down at once,","And ate with tumult in the naked hall,","Feeding like horses when you hear them feed;","Till Enid shrank far back into herself,","To shun the wild ways of the lawless tribe.","But when Earl Doorm had eaten all he would,","He rolled his eyes about the hall, and found","A damsel drooping in a corner of it.","Then he remembered her, and how she wept;","And out of her there came a power upon him;","And rising on the sudden he said, 'Eat!","I never yet beheld a thing so pale.","God's curse, it makes me mad to see you weep.","Eat! Look yourself. Good luck had your good man,","For were I dead who is it would weep for me?","Sweet lady, never since I first drew breath","Have I beheld a lily like yourself.","And so there lived some colour in your cheek,","There is not one among my gentlewomen","Were fit to wear your slipper for a glove.","But listen to me, and by me be ruled,","And I will do the thing I have not done,","For ye shall share my earldom with me, girl,","And we will live like two birds in one nest,","And I will fetch you forage from all fields,","For I compel all creatures to my will.'","","He spoke: the brawny spearman let his cheek","Bulge with the unswallowed piece, and turning stared;","While some, whose souls the old serpent long had drawn","Down, as the worm draws in the withered leaf","And makes it earth, hissed each at other's ear","What shall not be recorded--women they,","Women, or what had been those gracious things,","But now desired the humbling of their best,","Yea, would have helped him to it: and all at once","They hated her, who took no thought of them,","But answered in low voice, her meek head yet","Drooping, 'I pray you of your courtesy,","He being as he is, to let me be.'","","She spake so low he hardly heard her speak,","But like a mighty patron, satisfied","With what himself had done so graciously,","Assumed that she had thanked him, adding, 'Yea,","Eat and be glad, for I account you mine.'","","She answered meekly, 'How should I be glad","Henceforth in all the world at anything,","Until my lord arise and look upon me?'","","Here the huge Earl cried out upon her talk,","As all but empty heart and weariness","And sickly nothing; suddenly seized on her,","And bare her by main violence to the board,","And thrust the dish before her, crying, 'Eat.'","","'No, no,' said Enid, vext, 'I will not eat","Till yonder man upon the bier arise,","And eat with me.' 'Drink, then,' he answered. 'Here!'","(And filled a horn with wine and held it to her,)","'Lo! I, myself, when flushed with fight, or hot,","God's curse, with anger--often I myself,","Before I well have drunken, scarce can eat:","Drink therefore and the wine will change thy will.'","","'Not so,' she cried, 'by Heaven, I will not drink","Till my dear lord arise and bid me do it,","And drink with me; and if he rise no more,","I will not look at wine until I die.'","","At this he turned all red and paced his hall,","Now gnawed his under, now his upper lip,","And coming up close to her, said at last:","'Girl, for I see ye scorn my courtesies,","Take warning: yonder man is surely dead;","And I compel all creatures to my will.","Not eat nor drink? And wherefore wail for one,","Who put your beauty to this flout and scorn","By dressing it in rags? Amazed am I,","Beholding how ye butt against my wish,","That I forbear you thus: cross me no more.","At least put off to please me this poor gown,","This silken rag, this beggar-woman's weed:","I love that beauty should go beautifully:","For see ye not my gentlewomen here,","How gay, how suited to the house of one","Who loves that beauty should go beautifully?","Rise therefore; robe yourself in this: obey.'","","He spoke, and one among his gentlewomen","Displayed a splendid silk of foreign loom,","Where like a shoaling sea the lovely blue","Played into green, and thicker down the front","With jewels than the sward with drops of dew,","When all night long a cloud clings to the hill,","And with the dawn ascending lets the day","Strike where it clung: so thickly shone the gems.","","But Enid answered, harder to be moved","Than hardest tyrants in their day of power,","With life-long injuries burning unavenged,","And now their hour has come; and Enid said:","","'In this poor gown my dear lord found me first,","And loved me serving in my father's hall:","In this poor gown I rode with him to court,","And there the Queen arrayed me like the sun:","In this poor gown he bad me clothe myself,","When now we rode upon this fatal quest","Of honour, where no honour can be gained:","And this poor gown I will not cast aside","Until himself arise a living man,","And bid me cast it. I have griefs enough:","Pray you be gentle, pray you let me be:","I never loved, can never love but him:","Yea, God, I pray you of your gentleness,","He being as he is, to let me be.'","","Then strode the brute Earl up and down his hall,","And took his russet beard between his teeth;","Last, coming up quite close, and in his mood","Crying, 'I count it of no more avail,","Dame, to be gentle than ungentle with you;","Take my salute,' unknightly with flat hand,","However lightly, smote her on the cheek.","","Then Enid, in her utter helplessness,","And since she thought, 'He had not dared to do it,","Except he surely knew my lord was dead,'","Sent forth a sudden sharp and bitter cry,","As of a wild thing taken in the trap,","Which sees the trapper coming through the wood.","","This heard Geraint, and grasping at his sword,","(It lay beside him in the hollow shield),","Made but a single bound, and with a sweep of it","Shore through the swarthy neck, and like a ball","The russet-bearded head rolled on the floor.","So died Earl Doorm by him he counted dead.","And all the men and women in the hall","Rose when they saw the dead man rise, and fled","Yelling as from a spectre, and the two","Were left alone together, and he said:","","'Enid, I have used you worse than that dead man;","Done you more wrong: we both have undergone","That trouble which has left me thrice your own:","Henceforward I will rather die than doubt.","And here I lay this penance on myself,","Not, though mine own ears heard you yestermorn--","You thought me sleeping, but I heard you say,","I heard you say, that you were no true wife:","I swear I will not ask your meaning in it:","I do believe yourself against yourself,","And will henceforward rather die than doubt.'","","And Enid could not say one tender word,","She felt so blunt and stupid at the heart:","She only prayed him, 'Fly, they will return","And slay you; fly, your charger is without,","My palfrey lost.' 'Then, Enid, shall you ride","Behind me.' 'Yea,' said Enid, 'let us go.'","And moving out they found the stately horse,","Who now no more a vassal to the thief,","But free to stretch his limbs in lawful fight,","Neighed with all gladness as they came, and stooped","With a low whinny toward the pair: and she","Kissed the white star upon his noble front,","Glad also; then Geraint upon the horse","Mounted, and reached a hand, and on his foot","She set her own and climbed; he turned his face","And kissed her climbing, and she cast her arms","About him, and at once they rode away.","","And never yet, since high in Paradise","O'er the four rivers the first roses blew,","Came purer pleasure unto mortal kind","Than lived through her, who in that perilous hour","Put hand to hand beneath her husband's heart,","And felt him hers again: she did not weep,","But o'er her meek eyes came a happy mist","Like that which kept the heart of Eden green","Before the useful trouble of the rain:","Yet not so misty were her meek blue eyes","As not to see before them on the path,","Right in the gateway of the bandit hold,","A knight of Arthur's court, who laid his lance","In rest, and made as if to fall upon him.","Then, fearing for his hurt and loss of blood,","She, with her mind all full of what had chanced,","Shrieked to the stranger 'Slay not a dead man!'","'The voice of Enid,' said the knight; but she,","Beholding it was Edyrn son of Nudd,","Was moved so much the more, and shrieked again,","'O cousin, slay not him who gave you life.'","And Edyrn moving frankly forward spake:","'My lord Geraint, I greet you with all love;","I took you for a bandit knight of Doorm;","And fear not, Enid, I should fall upon him,","Who love you, Prince, with something of the love","Wherewith we love the Heaven that chastens us.","For once, when I was up so high in pride","That I was halfway down the slope to Hell,","By overthrowing me you threw me higher.","Now, made a knight of Arthur's Table Round,","And since I knew this Earl, when I myself","Was half a bandit in my lawless hour,","I come the mouthpiece of our King to Doorm","(The King is close behind me) bidding him","Disband himself, and scatter all his powers,","Submit, and hear the judgment of the King.'","","'He hears the judgment of the King of kings,'","Cried the wan Prince; 'and lo, the powers of Doorm","Are scattered,' and he pointed to the field,","Where, huddled here and there on mound and knoll,","Were men and women staring and aghast,","While some yet fled; and then he plainlier told","How the huge Earl lay slain within his hall.","But when the knight besought him, 'Follow me,","Prince, to the camp, and in the King's own ear","Speak what has chanced; ye surely have endured","Strange chances here alone;' that other flushed,","And hung his head, and halted in reply,","Fearing the mild face of the blameless King,","And after madness acted question asked:","Till Edyrn crying, 'If ye will not go","To Arthur, then will Arthur come to you,'","'Enough,' he said, 'I follow,' and they went.","But Enid in their going had two fears,","One from the bandit scattered in the field,","And one from Edyrn. Every now and then,","When Edyrn reined his charger at her side,","She shrank a little. In a hollow land,","From which old fires have broken, men may fear","Fresh fire and ruin. He, perceiving, said:","","'Fair and dear cousin, you that most had cause","To fear me, fear no longer, I am changed.","Yourself were first the blameless cause to make","My nature's prideful sparkle in the blood","Break into furious flame; being repulsed","By Yniol and yourself, I schemed and wrought","Until I overturned him; then set up","(With one main purpose ever at my heart)","My haughty jousts, and took a paramour;","Did her mock-honour as the fairest fair,","And, toppling over all antagonism,","So waxed in pride, that I believed myself","Unconquerable, for I was wellnigh mad:","And, but for my main purpose in these jousts,","I should have slain your father, seized yourself.","I lived in hope that sometime you would come","To these my lists with him whom best you loved;","And there, poor cousin, with your meek blue eyes","The truest eyes that ever answered Heaven,","Behold me overturn and trample on him.","Then, had you cried, or knelt, or prayed to me,","I should not less have killed him. And so you came,--","But once you came,--and with your own true eyes","Beheld the man you loved (I speak as one","Speaks of a service done him) overthrow","My proud self, and my purpose three years old,","And set his foot upon me, and give me life.","There was I broken down; there was I saved:","Though thence I rode all-shamed, hating the life","He gave me, meaning to be rid of it.","And all the penance the Queen laid upon me","Was but to rest awhile within her court;","Where first as sullen as a beast new-caged,","And waiting to be treated like a wolf,","Because I knew my deeds were known, I found,","Instead of scornful pity or pure scorn,","Such fine reserve and noble reticence,","Manners so kind, yet stately, such a grace","Of tenderest courtesy, that I began","To glance behind me at my former life,","And find that it had been the wolf's indeed:","And oft I talked with Dubric, the high saint,","Who, with mild heat of holy oratory,","Subdued me somewhat to that gentleness,","Which, when it weds with manhood, makes a man.","And you were often there about the Queen,","But saw me not, or marked not if you saw;","Nor did I care or dare to speak with you,","But kept myself aloof till I was changed;","And fear not, cousin; I am changed indeed.'","","He spoke, and Enid easily believed,","Like simple noble natures, credulous","Of what they long for, good in friend or foe,","There most in those who most have done them ill.","And when they reached the camp the King himself","Advanced to greet them, and beholding her","Though pale, yet happy, asked her not a word,","But went apart with Edyrn, whom he held","In converse for a little, and returned,","And, gravely smiling, lifted her from horse,","And kissed her with all pureness, brother-like,","And showed an empty tent allotted her,","And glancing for a minute, till he saw her","Pass into it, turned to the Prince, and said:","","'Prince, when of late ye prayed me for my leave","To move to your own land, and there defend","Your marches, I was pricked with some reproof,","As one that let foul wrong stagnate and be,","By having looked too much through alien eyes,","And wrought too long with delegated hands,","Not used mine own: but now behold me come","To cleanse this common sewer of all my realm,","With Edyrn and with others: have ye looked","At Edyrn? have ye seen how nobly changed?","This work of his is great and wonderful.","His very face with change of heart is changed.","The world will not believe a man repents:","And this wise world of ours is mainly right.","Full seldom doth a man repent, or use","Both grace and will to pick the vicious quitch","Of blood and custom wholly out of him,","And make all clean, and plant himself afresh.","Edyrn has done it, weeding all his heart","As I will weed this land before I go.","I, therefore, made him of our Table Round,","Not rashly, but have proved him everyway","One of our noblest, our most valorous,","Sanest and most obedient: and indeed","This work of Edyrn wrought upon himself","After a life of violence, seems to me","A thousand-fold more great and wonderful","Than if some knight of mine, risking his life,","My subject with my subjects under him,","Should make an onslaught single on a realm","Of robbers, though he slew them one by one,","And were himself nigh wounded to the death.'","","So spake the King; low bowed the Prince, and felt","His work was neither great nor wonderful,","And past to Enid's tent; and thither came","The King's own leech to look into his hurt;","And Enid tended on him there; and there","Her constant motion round him, and the breath","Of her sweet tendance hovering over him,","Filled all the genial courses of his blood","With deeper and with ever deeper love,","As the south-west that blowing Bala lake","Fills all the sacred Dee.
